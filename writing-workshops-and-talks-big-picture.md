Some notes on the big picture side of presenting ideas.

## Teaching and learning

### Four phases of learning

- Preparation
  - Interest. Positive feelings, optimal state for learning.
- Presentation
  - Encounter. Interesting, enjoyable, relevant, multi-sensory.
- Practice
  - Integration. Incorporate new knowledge.
- Performance
  - Application. Apply and extend knowledge.

### Ingredients of Accelerated Learning

- Somatic
  - moving and doing
- Auditory
  - talking and hearing
- Visual
  - observing and picturing
- Intellectual
  - problem-solving and reflecting

### Better > Worse

- Movement > Sitting
- Talking > Listening
- Images > Words
- Writing > Reading
- Shorter > Longer
- Different > Same

### Training From The Back Of The Room

- Connections
  - to each other
  - to the topic
  - to learning goals and outcomes
- Concepts
  - Teach only the need to know information
  - Use graphic organisers
  - Include 1 minute reviews
- Concrete Practice
  - Mistakes are allowed (expected!)
- Celebrations

## Change and motivation

### A, B, C

- **Asking:** the statement or action you're asking for.
- **Becausing:** the data and facts that explain why.
- **Convincing:** the response to anticipated challenges.

### Motivate change

- Direct the Rider
  - Follow the bright spots
  - Have a destination postcard
  - Script the critical steps
- Motivate the Elephant
  - Find the feeling
  - Shrink the change
  - Promote a growth mindset
- Shape the Path
  - Tweak the environment
  - Rally the herd
  - Make it a habit

Careful of the Fundamental Attribution Error: maybe it's the situation and not the person.

### Three realms of disagreement

- What is true?
- What is meaningful?
- What is useful?

Things to check:

- Is everyone arguing in the same realm?
- Is it actually about urgency, priority, grieving, solidarity?

### Diagreement Template

- Learn
  - Facts and evidence
  - (Multiple, diverse) Interpretations
  - (Multiple) Values
- Orient
  - Shared values
  - Proposal
  - Discussion
- Act
  - Commit
  - Check-in tripwire
  - Measurement of success

### Heirarchy for motivating change

- Intrinsic motivation (enlighten, inspire)
  - Feels like: the right thing to do; the smart thing to do; making a difference; helping people.
  - From seeing the real world benefits to people.
- Extrinsic motivation (rewards)
  - Helps, but focuses on the practitioner, not beneficiaries.
  - Can result in doing it just for the reward.
- External control (guilt, punishment)
  - Sets a low bar. Can result in doing the minimum amount of work necessary and othering the beneficaries.

### Planning the change

- Attractive
  - Link a reward with a good action
- Satisfying
  - Use a habit tracker, visual record of progress
- Easy
  - Start with small, quick, wins
- Obvious
  - Use Implementation Intentions, tweak the environment
