### The opportunity

[Code Collective](https://codecollective.com/) is a team of talented developers that work on complex, large scale, applications. They're most interested in, and focus on, making the back-end of their work rock solid. I talked to [Greg, the CEO](https://codecollective.com/our-team/), about helping **bring more focus to the front-end and to user experience**. In particular, they have a long-running project on a legacy tech stack. This needed an updated look and feel and a set of UX eyes on it.

### The work

Over several sessions we've worked on a range of front-end and UX things.

- **Workshops on personas and journey maps**, resulting in low and medium fidelity deliverables.
- **UX reviews of the existing application**. We took the famous "10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design" and adapted it to better suit the team's needs. Then we reviewed a handful of screens using our new checklist to find some quick wins to improve the user experience.
- Conducted a series of **interviews and usability testing** with existing customers. We did this to find out more about how they use the system, and what their [pains, gains, and jobs to be done](https://naga.co.za/img/tools/value-proposition-jobs-gains-pains.png) were.
- Had a series of **discussions around workflows and integrating more user-centered thinking** into the existing development process. The Business Impact and Acceptance Criteria fields of the team's JIRA issues now contain FED and UX things.

For the large, legacy, application, we took a **slow and steady iterative approach** to the changes. Chats with the support team, and interviews and usability testing with customers, showed that the user base is quite strongly change averse. We agreed on a plan for updating the look and feel of the application to make it more modern and minimal. It was important that we do this without making big, scary, changes for the users. For me as a front-end developer, this has meant a few things.

- **Refactoring CSS** for smaller, cleaner, files. The application had several Themes with a fair amount of shared look and feel. The weight of the common.css and theme CSS files didn't accurately reflect this.
- **Refactoring the HTML** views into simpler, more semantic, code. This resulted in lighter, faster, pages, and makes it to update styling.
- Updating existing styles and adding new styles to **make it responsive**.

### The outcomes

- Personas are being used at the start of new projects, to help the team better understand the customers needs and goals.
- From the UX review, we made a long list of quick wins (things that are low effort but high impact). Then we reviewed and prioritised them, and put a small batch into the team's Kanban board. Many of these have been completed and are out on production.
- The large, legacy, application is becoming more modern each sprint. The changes are small enough not to jump out and shout at the user, but big enough to make a difference in how easy the system is for them to use.

### The client's thoughts

> I enjoy that Steve works towards good value / effort optimisations. He’s practical. I enjoyed that he brings UX and design thinking to the team. The team find him approachable and feel they have gained insights and learnings.
