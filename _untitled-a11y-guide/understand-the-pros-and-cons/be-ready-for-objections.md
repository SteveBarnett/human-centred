Be ready for objections with rebuttals and “but/and”s

Some commons objections

- Other things are higher priority
- It’s boring, it’s not shiny or glamorous
- It’s difficult. It’s easy to do ARIA wrong and make things worse.
- It’s takes too long.
- People with disabilities are not our target market
- only affects a small group of users
- We don't have support to do it
- It's only realistic / practical / possible on small projects
- We can quickly add accessibility before the release
- We can use an overlay
- Web accessibility is just a developer's responsibility
- Automated tools are enough
- Compliance is enough
- It’s all about ARIA
