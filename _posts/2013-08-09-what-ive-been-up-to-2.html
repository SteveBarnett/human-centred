<p>The last few months have been quite busy: I seem to keep picking up extra-curricular activities. My personal and professional interests tend to blend together a bit.</p>
<p>At the end of July, after many weeks of planning and preparation, myself and a fine team of teachers and organisers ran our first <a href="http://railsbridgecapetown.org/">RailsBridge Cape Town</a>.  <a href="http://railsbridgecapetown.org/2013-07.html">Read details of the workshop</a>, or <a href="http://railsbridgecapetown.org/2013/08/01/railsbridge-july-2013-review.html">read our review of how it went</a>. Short version of the review: really well!</p>
<p>The <a href="http://devicelab.co.za/">Device Lab</a> is still going strong. I've updated <a href="http://devicelab.co.za/the-lab.php#devicesinthelab">the device list</a> recently to include an Apple iPhone 5, a ZTE X990, and a Nintendo 3DS XL. I hope to soon add a Windows phone. Some of the attendees of the lab have also been kind enough to add <a href="http://opendevicelab.com/#!odl=214">comments on the listing on Open Device Lab.com</a>.</p>
<p>Last month I signed myself up for another year on <a href="http://www.spin.org.za/steering-committee/">the SPIN Steering Committee</a>. I've helped knock the web site into shape a little, refreshed the logo, and tried to help bring a more diverse range of topics and speakers to the meetings.</p>
