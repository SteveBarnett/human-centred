<p>I think it would be a little melodramatic to say that <a href="http://hardboiledwebdesign.com/">Hardboiled Web Design</a> by <a href="http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/">Andy Clarke</a> changed my life, but it's not that far from the truth. I bought the electronic version of the book on the day it came out from <a href="http://www.fivesimplesteps.com/">Five Simple Steps</a> and raced through it. Something about the "no compromise" approach really resonated with me, and I became very excited about my work again. I was hungry to try new things and work even harder than before.<br />
The worked examples of the various bits of HTML5 and CSS3 look beautiful (which I find is not always the case in web design books), but what really go me going was Part 1 of the book: the day to day practicalities, how do you sell this to clients, and so on.</p>
<p>I bought the paperback a short while after, and I'm glad I did: it's a thing of beauty and a weighty tome forever. I find that paper books have a stronger visual memory hook for me. I find them easier to dive back into and flick through to find a particular technique or idea that I want to revisit.</p>
<p>This list from the end of the <a href="http://hardboiledwebdesign.com/workshops/">Workshop page</a> sums up the Hardboiled approach quite nicely:</p>
<hr />
<strong>At the end of the day, you&#8217;ll understand</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Why web browsers don&#8217;t limit your creativity</li>
<li>That websites shouldnâ€™t look, or be experienced the same in every browser</li>
<li>How to handle older, less capable browsers</li>
<li>That browser differences are creative and business opportunities, not obstacles</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>A parting aside: Five Simple Steps has a small but strong catalogue and is well worth perusing. I'm particularly fond of Brian Suda's <a href="http://www.fivesimplesteps.com/products/a-practical-guide-to-designing-with-data">Designing with Data</a>. It tickles all my minimalism muscles, and he's pleasingly rude about Chart Junk.</p>
