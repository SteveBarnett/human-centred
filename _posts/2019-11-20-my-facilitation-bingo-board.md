When I do talks or workshops, I like have only little bits of me talking and lots of bits of people **doing stuff**. I use [my big "writing, workshops, and talks" list](/writing-workshops-and-talks/) to plan the thing as a whole. I use something a bit smaller for planning the specific activities throughout: a little facilitation bingo board.

### General Principles for activities

- keep them short;
- mix them up;
- make them active;
- ask questions.

### The bingo board

<table>
<caption>My facilitation bingo board: how I vary activities by process, humans, format and location.</caption>
    <tr>
        <th scope="row">Process <span aria-hidden="true">→</span></th>
        <td>Think</td>
        <td>Do</td>
        <td>Review</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th scope="row">Humans <span aria-hidden="true">→</span></th>
        <td>Single</td>
        <td>Pair</td>
        <td>Group</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th scope="row">Format <span aria-hidden="true">→</span></th>
        <td>Read</td>
        <td>Write / Draw / Talk</td>
        <td>Make</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th scope="row">Location <span aria-hidden="true">→</span></th>
        <td>Here</td>
        <td>There</td>
        <td>Over there</td>
    </tr>
</table>

A first batch of activities might look like this.

- Think, Single, Write, Here.
  - On a sticky note, write down what you want to get from this workshop.
- Think, Pair, Talk, Over There.
  - Share your goals with someone on the other side of the room.
- Do, Group, Make, Here.
  - As a table, construct a [proto-persona](https://naga.co.za/2018/04/23/project-personas/) for your current product or project.
- Review, Pair, Talk, There.
  - With a partner, discuss what surprised you about the persona you made.
