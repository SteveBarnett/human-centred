This Thursday, May 19th 2022, is the 11th annual [GAAD (Global Accessibility Awareness Day)](https://accessibility.day/). Here's something a bit silly and nerdy to celebrate it.

Player characters in DnD have six stats: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. I like this daft tomato-based explanation: 

- Strength is being able to crush a tomato.
- Dexterity is being able to dodge a tomato.
- Constitution is being able to eat a bad tomato.
- Intelligence is knowing tomato is a fruit.
- Wisdom is knowing not to put a tomato in a fruit salad.
- Charisma is being able to sell a tomato-based fruit salad.

What might these look like for an adventurer doing web accessibility? And what are the skills that support each stat?

## (Accessibility) Strength

This is about **doing**. Some skills that support that:

- Using standard controls where possible
- Writing semantic HTML
- Doing Static Analysis (Linting) and writing Automated Tests

## (Accessibility) Dexterity

This is about **flexibility**. Some skills that support that:

- Testing with the keyboard
- Testing with browser extensions
- Testing with Screen Readers

## (Accessibility) Constitution

This is about **persistence**. Some skills that support that:

- Shifting Left
- Choosing accessibility as a priority
- Offering feedback to the previous step

## (Accessibility) Intelligence

This is about **wide** knowledge. Some skills that support that:

- Understanding the accessibility tree
- Understanding ARIA
- Knowing the Standards

## (Accessibility) Wisdom

This is about **deep** knowledge. Some skills that support that:

- Thinking non-binary: acknowledging and embracing human diversity
- Going off The Happy Path
- Avoiding barriers to access: making it more usable for more people

## (Accessibility) Charisma

This is about **persuasion**. Some skills that support that:

- Offering good motivations
- Being ready for objections
- Celebrating good accessibility

## Time to level up

How do you want to level up this year? What skill do you want to get a bit better at? I have two in particular that I'll be focusing on.

- **Writing Automated Tests**. I do a lot of manual testing, and some unit tests with axe. But I want to investigate efficient and useful end-to-end testing for a11y.
- **Celebrating good accessibility**. I spend a fair amount of time talking about the pros and cons. But I often miss chances to celebrate the good work that teams do.
