<p>There's a very nice article by Marc Drummond on responsive design, <a href="http://marcdrummond.com/web-standards/2011/06/20/hell-bad-devices-responsive-web-design-and-web-standards">To hell with bad devices: Responsive web design and web standards</a>, which covers lots of the points I've been thinking about recently. The one that really struck a cord is in the <strong>Responsive vs device-specific design: Workforce considerations</strong> section: there has to be a balance between having just a small screen and large screen version and having a whole basket of breakpoints. It has to stay practical.</p>
<p>Responsive design is exciting, but it's also very new and the web design community is still figuring out how it works and what to do with it. <a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/">Luke W</a>'s famous Mobile First approach combined with responsive design is a very pleasing way of approaching a new project. I think that the wide side is the most challenging to deal with: what do you do when you've got over 2,500 pixels of width to play with?</p>
<p>Marc's article also contrasts nicely with the <a href="http://www.lukejones.me/post/6651505197/responsive-web-design">vaguely trolly article by Luke Jones</a> that's been doing the rounds the past few days. </p>
