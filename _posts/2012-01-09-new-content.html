<p>I'm playing around with a redesign for the site, trying out new things I've learned and new ways of approaching various problems.<br />
My first step was to look at the content. Discussions with clients during last year and the number of new approaches and ways of thinking that have been popping up in the web design and development world made me decide to write these two reference pages: <a href="http://174.120.62.98/~naga/web-site-basics/" title="Web Site Basics">Web Site Basics</a> and <a href="http://174.120.62.98/~naga/how-i-do-things/" title="How I Do Things">How I do things</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://174.120.62.98/~naga/web-site-basics/" title="Web Site Basics">Web Site Basics</a> is aimed at the complete beginner. It answers the questions: "What makes up a web site?" and "How can I keep it up to date?"</p>
<p><a href="http://174.120.62.98/~naga/how-i-do-things/" title="How I Do Things">How I do things</a> is more News and Current Affairs in the Web Development world: One Web; Progressive Enhancement; Responsive Web Design; Mobile First / Content First. It's a brief summary of the direction things are going and a round up of the thinking of a lot of smart cookies out there.</p>
