description: Some common objections to doing accessibility work, and ways that I've addressed them.
---

I'm a big fan of human-centered design (which I think of as inclusive design and accessibility) and human-centered development (which I think of as progressive enhancement). When talking about these things, it's not uncommon to be confronted with "yeah but"s.

I've found that the way to address these is to dig a little bit first (using a [five whys map](/2017/07/03/five-whys-map/) or [a cause and effect map](https://retromat.org/blog/cause-effect-diagrams-25/) or a similar structure) to find the underlying reason for the objection. Here are some common objections and ways that I've addressed them (with varying degrees of success, of course!). These aren't complete arguments, just starting points to get talking. It's not about who's right and who's wrong: it's about finding common ground somewhere in the middle and trying to do what's best for our users.

<ul>
    {% for yeahbuttal in site.data.yeahbuttals %}
    <li>
        <strong>"Yeah, but {{ yeahbuttal.yeahbut }}"</strong>
        <ul>
            {% for rebuttal in yeahbuttal.rebuttals %}
            <li>
                {{ rebuttal | markdownify }}
            </li>
            {% endfor %}
        </ul>
    </li>
    {% endfor %}
</ul>
