<p>Over the past few days I read through <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Training-Back-Room-Aside-Learn-ebook/dp/B0062O7L7S/">Sharon Bowman&#8217;s book &#8220;Training from the back of the room.&#8221;</a> I mostly read it to give me some new ideas for <a href="http://railsbridgecapetown.org/">RailsBridge Cape Town</a>, but also because I generally want to improve my facilitation skills. They&#8217;re kind of the same reasons that I went on <a href="http://growingagile.co.za/">Growing Agile</a>&#8217;s great Facilitation workshop last year, which uses a bunch of the techniques in Ms Bowman&#8217;s book.</p>
<p>Quite a lot of my job is arguing about / selling people on ideas and approaches (building with Progressive Enhancement, or Responsive Web Design, or adopting a particularly User-Centered Design flavour of User Experience). I&#8217;ve also been trying to keep in mind Mike Monteiro&#8217;s advice in his books and talks (which are about being a Designer, but lots of the lessons apply across disciplines. Check out <a href="https://vimeo.com/121082134">his keynote at Interaction15</a>).</p>
<h3 id="whatilearntaboutrailsbridge">What I learnt about RailsBridge</h3>
<p>Reading Ms Bowman&#8217;s book, my biggest realisation was that <strong>we need to be a lot more learner- and learning objective-focused</strong>. We&#8217;ve made a lot of changes to the course since July 2013, and added lots of good things (based on feedback from the students), but we haven&#8217;t added them all in ways that are really learner-focused. The changes tend towards more of us talking, and not more of them doing, which it should be.</p>
<p>In particular, we&#8217;ve added some contextualising / explaining into the opening presentation. <strong>We should be doing these things as activities by the students instead</strong>. We also need a much better as-they-arrive set up. At the moment, they&#8217;re welcomed, grab a drink and a name tag, but <strong>they should start with something topic-related immediately</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="feedback">Feedback</h3>
<p>We&#8217;re care a lot about feedback at our RailsBridge because <strong>we&#8217;re really interested in continuous improvement</strong>. After reading Ms Bowman&#8217;s book, I realise that we&#8217;re doing it a bit wrong: our feedback mechanisms have been great for us, but <strong>we should be focusing on it being great for the students</strong>. We started this a bit with using pair-teaching at recent RailsBridges, but we need to keep moving in that direction.</p>
<p>One of the challenges we face is pacing: our students arrive and (especially) leave at very varied times. <strong>This makes it difficult to do things that involve big groups of people</strong>: we can do single and pair activities fairly easily, though, so we&#8217;ll need to focus on those.</p>
<h3 id="nextsteps">Next steps</h3>
<p><strong>There&#8217;s so much good stuff in the book</strong> that it&#8217;ll take a while for it all to sink in. I think that the book would have worked slightly better for me in print. I&#8217;ve ordered a paper copy (I read it this time on Kindle) so that I can re-read it, scribble in it, and make notes.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also going to <strong>make up index cards of the 65 activities in the book and have them as a deck of cards</strong>. I&#8217;m going to use that deck to help me figure out which activitieswould work best at RailsBridge.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Training-Back-Room-Aside-Learn-ebook/dp/B0062O7L7S/">Training from the back of the room</a> and learned a lot about how the brain works, and a better way of teaching. I hope it will help me make some changes that will mean a better learning experience for RailsBridge attendees.</p>
