<p>Last night the SPIN committee hosted <a href="http://www.spin.org.za/2013/11/14/ct-spin-95-spinjam-software-product-development-at-corporations-and-startups/">the 95th SPIN meeting, and our third annual SPINJam</a>. We had a panel discussion on the topic of &#8220;Software Product Development at Corporations and Startups.&#8221; Some interesting points were raised by the panel members and the audience. Below are a few that stood out for me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Process is always the first thing to be blamed when something goes wrong. In startups, process tends to light; in corporates it tends to be rigid and heavy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps a more important question than startup or corporate is supportoing a system or developing a product. This informs the culture and style of a company.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>These days, there are a large number of developers for whom the job is a profession, not a passion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Small team size is important. Teams need to have ownership of their work, and autonomy. Amazon works with teams smaller than 10 people.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>People join startups not for the money, but for the values and ideals.</p>

<p>Look for people who want to be great at what they do: craftsmen, and reward them well for it.</p>

<p>Lots of startups are spin-offs from or branches of a corporate.</p>
