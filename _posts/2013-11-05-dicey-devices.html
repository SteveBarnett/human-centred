<p>I&#8217;m taking part in a one and half day hackathon today and tomorrow, and I&#8217;ve decided to build a thing. It&#8217;s called Dicey Devices and it&#8217;s a responsive preview tool with a difference.</p>
<p>The focus of Dicey Devices is to remind us:</p>
<ul>
<li>about the huge diversity of devices that access the web;</li>
<li>about how many people are multi-device users;</li>
<li>the importance of <a href="http://devicelab.co.za/the-lab.php#whytestonrealdevices">testing on real devices</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;ll be pushing it live as I make it, over at <a href="http://stevebarnett.github.io/DiceyDevices/">stevebarnett.github.io/DiceyDevices</a>. The code behind it will be up <a href="https://github.com/SteveBarnett/DiceyDevices/tree/gh-pages">on GitHub</a>. Right now it&#8217;s empty!</p>
<h3 id="whybuildanotherresponsivetestingtool">Why build another responsive testing tool?</h3>
<p>There are <a href="http://bradfrost.github.io/this-is-responsive/resources.html#viewport-testing">lots out there already</a>. I feel that one thing that most of the tools get wrong is <strong>focusing a little too much on specific sizes or devices</strong>. This isn&#8217;t a very <a href="http://futurefriendly.co.za/">Future Friendly</a> approach. Although some let you enter widths and heights, most have either &#8220;mobile, tablet, desktop&#8221; or, worse, &#8220;iPhone, iPad, MacBook.&#8221; <a href="http://bradfrostweb.com/demo/ish/">Brad Frost&#8217;s ish</a> is perhaps my favourite: it has a <em>random</em> setting that is great for testing (and even the preset sizes are labelled like t-shirts, rather than being specific). </p>
<p>Seeing <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lukew/sets/72157636814608894">Luke W&#8217;s photos from Breaking Development of the lots of devices</a> reminded me of <a href="http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/post/this-is-the-web/">Brad Frost&#8217;s this is the web slides</a>: &#8220;This is not the web, this is the web, this will be the web&#8221;, and of <a href="https://placeit.net/">PlaceIt.net</a>, where you can add screen shots and see them &#8220;in real life.&#8221; These in turn led me to revisit <a href="http://ami.responsivedesign.is/">Justin Avery&#8217;s Am I Responsive</a>. This got me thinking that the existing tools don&#8217;t do a great job of reminding us that <strong>testing with real devices is very different to testing in a smaller browser window</strong>.</p>
<p>What I want to do with Dicey Devices is pull these things together a bit more. Like Brad&#8217;s last slide mashed up with Am I Responsive, but with the devices on display being randomised. If I have time I want to add &#8220;special effects&#8221; to the displays. Things like adding cracks to the screen, adding noise or glare, fading the colours to simulate an old or poor display, and so on.</p>
<p>Of course, Dicey Devices still only really looks at viewports as a variable, which is not great (see <a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1816">Luke&#8217;s post</a>, <a href="http://unstoppablerobotninja.com/entry/responsive-web-design-screens-and-shearing-layers/">Ethan&#8217;s response</a>, and <a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1817">Luke&#8217;s response response</a>). It&#8217;s more of a reference and nudge than a tool for proper testing.</p>
<h3 id="whydiceydevices">Why &#8220;Dicey Devices&#8221;?</h3>
<p>The Dicey refers to two things: the <strong>randomness</strong> of the selection (like dice, so that we don&#8217;t get hung up on specific resolutions) and the <strong>special effects</strong> simulating real world problems (like a dicey, dodgy, device, to remind us to test on real devices).<br />
Also, I like alliteration.</p>
