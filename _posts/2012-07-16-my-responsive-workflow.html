<p>One of the biggest challenges of thinking in a more <a title="Future Friendly" href="http://futurefriend.ly/">future friendly</a> way (acknowledging and embracing unpredictability), and building <a title="Responsive Web Design by Ethan Marcotte" href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/">responsive</a> web sites (sites that respond to the devices viewing it) is the change in <strong>workflow</strong>.</p>
<p>Here's an outline of the shape of my workflow these days.</p>
<ul>
<li>User Research</li>
<li>Content Strategy, Information Architecture</li>
<li>Iterate
<ul>
<li>Sketch</li>
<li>Style Tiles, Style Guides</li>
<li>Structured Content in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>, produce HTML</li>
<li>Prototype</li>
<li>Test</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Some background</h3>
<p>Traditionally, web sites have been made using a <a title="Waterfall model on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model">Waterfall model</a>: after the planning phase, flat Photoshop comps are produced and signed off. These are then used to build the web pages or Theme.</p>
<p>Given the large and rapidly increasing number of connected devices, it doesn't make sense to produce just one static comp for each web page. However, producing a range of comps for each page is impractical and inappropriate: doing so would be time-consuming, and couldn't fully represent the wide range of screen sizes and resolutions that the site will be viewed on.</p>
<p>So, coding starts early in the process. Prototypes are built so that the there's something fluid to review. The design becomes more focused towards chunks: small pieces of structured content. These chunks are then fed into the prototypes and, using a <a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?933">Mobile First</a> approach, the layout is designed as increasingly larger screen sizes and device features are considered. Then, a back and forth between designers and developers begins, tweaking and refining the layout and the chunks. The workflow process is starting to look more like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">Agile development</a>.</p>
