I joined the online version of [UX New Zealand](https://www.uxnewzealand.com/) this year. Here's one thing that stood out for me from each of a few of the talks.

### Day one

- Stop looking for who to include and start looking at what practices and mindsets are exclusionary (from "Consider the periphery" by [Elizabeth Lang](https://www.uxnewzealand.com/2020-speakers/elizabeth-lang/)).
- Make sure you don't stop at the MVP: keep refining it (from "More than an MVP: The case for continuous improvement in the COVID era" by [James Ford](https://www.uxnewzealand.com/2020-speakers/james-ford/) and [Pete Lister](https://www.uxnewzealand.com/2020-speakers/pete-lister/)).
- IRACIS model - Increase Revenue; Avoid Costs; Improve Service. (from "How to measure the experience (UX ROI)" by [Anna Bek](https://www.uxnewzealand.com/2020-speakers/anna-bek/)).
- Best way of learning is incremental, with low cognitive load (aka brainouch) (from "Take a load off: How to identify and reduce cognitive load" by [Clint Schnee](https://www.uxnewzealand.com/2020-speakers/clint-schnee/))
- "You can't be curious and defensive at the same time" – Peter Levine (from "'Bipartisan' UX: A call for the middle ground" by [Ruth Brown](https://www.uxnewzealand.com/2020-speakers/ruth-brown/))

I also made some sketchnotes 👇.

### Day two

- Value people's time (from "Design with mental health in mind" by [Bradley Gabr-Ryn](https://www.uxnewzealand.com/2020-speakers/bradley-gabr-ryn/)).
- Call things what they are (use clear, plain, language), e.g. "period care" not "feminine hygiene" or "sanitary products" (from "Wine, bacon and periods: Product categories and our journey to wrangle them" by [Jennie Leng](https://www.uxnewzealand.com/2020-speakers/jennie-leng/)).
- Stay (with the prototype) as long as needed, you're prototyping to learn (from "Prototyping the prototype: Evolving the design mindset" by [Julie Watson](https://www.uxnewzealand.com/2020-speakers/julie-watson/) and [Ruth Elliott](https://www.uxnewzealand.com/2020-speakers/ruth-elliott/)).
- Give people jobs to do, specific to their expertise (from "Presenting design work: And getting great feedback" by [Donna Spencer](https://www.uxnewzealand.com/2020-speakers/donna-spencer/)).

I also made some sketchnotes 👇.

### Summary

Phew! There was a lot in two days! I'll definitely be back next year.

Three principles / ideas that pull the talks together for me:

- Reframe, take a look from another angle;
- Take small, careful, steps;
- Be specific and clear.
