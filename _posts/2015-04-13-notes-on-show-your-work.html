<p>Over the weekend I read <a href="http://austinkleon.com/show-your-work/">Austin Kleon&#8217;s Show Your Work</a>. The book is about getting discovered and self-promotion, but I picked it up with a more general vibe in mind. Skimming through the preview I was hoping I would get some nuggets of good advice by reading it, and I wasn&#8217;t disappointed.</p>
<p>The book is divided into ten sections:</p>
<ol>
<li>You don’t have to be a genius.</li>
<li>Think process, not product.</li>
<li>Share something small every day.</li>
<li>Open up your cabinet of curiosities.</li>
<li>Tell good stories.</li>
<li>Teach what you know.</li>
<li>Don’t turn into human spam.</li>
<li>Learn to take a punch.</li>
<li>Sell out.</li>
<li>Stick around.</li>
</ol>

<p>Early in the book, Austin talks about collaboration and connections, in the context of being part of a group. I really dig this because that&#8217;s how I feel about all the meetups and things I&#8217;m involved with (<a href="http://www.meetup.com/ctfeds/">CTFEDs</a>, <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Cape-Town-SPIN/">SPIN</a>, <a href="http://www.meetup.com/RailsBridge-Cape-Town/">RailsBridge</a>. I loathe the term &#8220;networking,&#8221; but I do really enjoy hanging out with smart people, and talking about interesting things.</p>
<p>Other themes in the book were things like <strong>honest, openness and vulnerability</strong>: humans like connecting with other humans.</p>
<p>I also enjoyed his discussion around <strong>sharing something small every day</strong> (even though I mostly fail at doing that!): over time, doing lots of little things can add up to a big thing.</p>

<p>Having recently read <a href="http://bowperson.com/">Sharon Bowman</a>&#8217;s excellent <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Training-Back-Room-Aside-Learn-ebook/dp/B0062O7L7S/">Training From The Back Of The Room</a>, I really liked the section in Mr Kleon&#8217;s book on teaching what you know. He talks about how, <strong>by teaching other people what you know, you learn things yourself</strong>.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest takeaway from the book for me was the section that explains why <strong>sharing your work won&#8217;t put you out of business</strong>: quite the opposite in fact. I&#8217;ve had many arguments with people about this before. I&#8217;ve mostly tried to talk about how there is plenty work to go around and that it&#8217;s on a continuum (my clients aren&#8217;t necessarily the same as your clients). I&#8217;ve also tried to talk about how keeping things secret doesn&#8217;t work. If your only value to the client is that secrecy, then your business won&#8217;t last long. </p>
<p>Mr Kleon talks about how <strong>knowing the technique is very different from mastery of it</strong>. The various activities of User Experience are an excellent example of this. Usability testing has very simple steps (or so it seems): find a person, watch them use a product, and take notes. <strong>Doing it well is another matter entirely</strong>: who do you find; what tasks do they do; what do you ask them (and what do you not); what things are important (and not); how do you interpret the results? That knowledge only comes with practice and mentorship.</p>
<p>I guess it&#8217;s not surprising that nowadays I find myself working on Open Source projects like <a href="https://github.com/praekelt/vumi-go">Vumi</a> and <a href="https://github.com/universalcore">Universal Core</a>.</p>

<p>One last thing I took away was to &#8220;find my knuckleballers&#8221; - the people who <strong>share my mission and principles</strong>. For me, that&#8217;s focusing on <a href="https://pinboard.in/u:maxbarners/t:progressiveenhancement/">Progressive Enhancement</a>. I want to always be mindful of the worst case scenarios and build <a href="http://trentwalton.com/2014/03/10/device-agnostic/">things that will work on bad connections on hostile browsers</a>. I want to build things that work when JavaScript fails to load, things that load fast and <a href="http://whatdoesmysitecost.com/">don&#8217;t cost the users lots of money</a>.</p>
<p>It seems that there are very few people like that in Cape Town. <a href="http://justinslack.com/">Justin</a>, <a href="http://alex.maughan.me/">Alex</a>, and <a href="http://richarcher.co.uk/">Rich</a> are people whose work and principles I hold in high regard. </p>
