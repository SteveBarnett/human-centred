<p>Recently I ran a day of <a href="http://www.userexperience.co.za/our-usability-testing/">usability testing</a> for a client&#8217;s native application. It wasn&#8217;t the first time I&#8217;d taken part in testing, but it was the first time I&#8217;d run the tests myself. It was fun and exhilarating. The first one of the day was also pretty scary; at least it was until it started. I&#8217;m already sold on the benefits of usability testing, but the experience reinforced my feelings about it. </p>
<p>I asked for feedback from my colleagues afterwards, and tried to think critically about how I&#8217;d done, and how I could do better next time. I think that I established a rapport with the participants quite well. I found it easy to find interests that we had in common, and to chat to them about those. </p>
<p>In terms of improvement for the next one: I need to stop being so helpful. Part of testing is letting the users struggle for a bit, to see where the problems and sticking points are. I was a little too eager to help or to ask questions about what they were doing. It&#8217;s okay to let it get a bit awkward. Also, my questions were sometimes a little too leading, or I would finish their answers for them. I need to watch that, and just be more patient. </p>

<p>My biggest take-away from the day was the same as the other tests I&#8217;ve been involved with: how great it is for the clients. Seeing users with the app is a real eye-opener. They&#8217;re very good at showing you that things aren&#8217;t as obvious as you think (or at all), and at helping you realise that what&#8217;s important to you may not be the same thing that&#8217;s important to the user. </p>
<p>Running through the results with the client the week after the test was also great. Together we came up with a laundry list of changes that they could make to their app, and discussed prioritising them. On the one hand this could be seen as bad: lots of work to do. But the flip side is more important: lots of ways to improve the app, and make a real difference to the user experience. I can&#8217;t wait to run my next set of tests!</p>
