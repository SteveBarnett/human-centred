<p>One of my side projects is the <a href="http://devicelab.co.za/">Nomad Device Lab</a>. It&#8217;s an <a href="http://opendevicelab.com/">Open Device Lab</a>: a shared community pool of internet-connected devices that&#8217;s <strong>free to use</strong> for testing purposes by web and app developers. If you do a <a href="https://www.google.co.za/search?q=device+lab&amp;tbm=isch">Google image search for device lab</a>, you see a lot of walls of devices. For me, this feels a bit off.</p>
<p>Having all the devices on the wall is okay for testing layout and general functionality, but it misses a bit part of the testing: <strong>the user experience</strong>.</p>
<p>One difference is <strong>the physical experience</strong>: how you hold and interact with the device. Tapping a phone mounted on a wall is not the same as the more usual use case of using it with one hand and one thumb.</p>
<p>Another difference is <strong>performance</strong>: the speed of the site. Even though phones and tablets (and many other types of internet-connected devices) are getting faster, they&#8217;re still slow compared to their laptop and desktop counterparts. It&#8217;s hard to gauge just how slow when you&#8217;re looking at a wall of devices all updating.</p>
<p>Although I&#8217;m a big fan of apps like <a href="http://vanamco.com/ghostlab/">Ghostlab</a> and tools like <a href="http://www.browsersync.io/">BrowserSync</a> (which I use a lot), taking the time to sit and play with your sites manually on a range of devices really lets you feel the pain of loading and interaction times.</p>
