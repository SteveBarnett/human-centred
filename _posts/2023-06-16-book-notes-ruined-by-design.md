[Ruined By Design](https://www.ruinedby.design/) is an excellent design ethics and activism book by Mike Monteiro. These are my notes from it.

I've **bolded** and added a "★" to my favourite little bits below.

<details>
	<summary>Quick list of just the star-bolded bits</summary>
	<ul>
		<li>We need to measure impact, not just profit.</li>
		<li>“It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it.” ― Upton Sinclair</li>
		<li>The current system rewards growth, however it comes.</li>
		<li>Free speech means amplifying those who have been silenced, not protecting the silencers.</li>
		<li>We look out for the people not in the room.</li>
		<li>Our work should be evaluated by how well it solves the problem, without creating new ones.</li>
		<li>Societies are made of agreements to follow laws more than laws.</li>
		<li>Welcome, encourage, criticism to create better work.</li>
		<li>It's only inclusion from the white boys side of the room. For everyone else, it's exclusion.</li>

## Big picture

- By our action or inaction, the world behaves as it has been designed to.
- Designing badly can mean problems are in the foundation, and only a tear-down will fix them.
- The world isn't changed by special people, it's changed by ordinary people taking a stand.
- Startups go from "build a business" to "aim for liquidation". Investors push for growth, instead of quality. They only care about the short-term, until liquidation.

## Priorities

- Bad things happen when we prioritise "engagement" or money above all.
- **★ We need to measure impact, not just profit.**
- Excessive speed tends to blur our purpose, make us miss problems.
	- Slowing down to think about impact is a feature, not a bug.
- People don't see the things they're rewarded for as problems to fix.
- **★ “It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it.” ― Upton Sinclair**
- **★ The current system rewards growth, however it comes.**
- When making money is the most important other things are secondary by definition.

## Ethics

- Do the right thing, even / especially in environments designed to make it easier to do the wrong thing.
- The exchange of cash for services does not supersede ethics.
- Something design to harm is not well-designed.
- **★ Free speech means amplifying those who have been silenced, not protecting the silencers.**
- "The algorithm" is good for a lack of accountability. Good leaders should have their fingerprints all over difficult decisions.
- Ethical work is more important than ethical extra-curriculars.
- We need our best people where our biggest problems are.
- We are responsible for what we put in the world.

## More than just pushing pixels

- We owe people our advice as well as our labour.
- **★ We look out for the people not in the room.**
- People hire us to do a service, but they're not hiring a servant.
- Good work is about craft and responsibility.
- **★ Our work should be evaluated by how well it solves the problem, without creating new ones.**

## License

- Skilled professionals get licensed. The license gets taken away when necessary.
- Oaths don't stop unethical behaviour, but they do stop people claiming ignorance.
- The code applies wherever we work.
- Plenty of legal activities are unethical.
	- Sometimes the law back us up, sometimes it's slow to catch up.
- **★ Societies are made of agreements to follow laws more than laws.**
	- Laws are top-down (so they have no transformative power), agreements are bottom-up.

## Feedback and questions

- **★ Welcome, encourage, criticism to create better work.**
- Be aware of our biases and welcome having them checked.
- Asking why, saying no, are design skills.
- We design things that fit our experiences.
	- We can only ask questions we think to ask.

## Test

- Involve our audience more to solve the problem more thoroughly.
- Edge cases imply there are people whose problems aren't worth solving.
	- They are humans, we owe them our best work.
- Use [John Rawls' Veil of Ignorance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_position).
- "Show me the data!"? Just look around us at the current garbage fire!

## Speak up

- Standing up for the right thing might be the spark that ignites others.
- Be the one that motivates those around you to do their best.
- Speak up to show our peers what's not okay.
- **★ It's only inclusion from the white boys side of the room. For everyone else, it's exclusion.**
- Speaking up is part of the job.
