<p>I spotted an article the other day (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/article/20140823151753-138782510-getting-the-most-out-of-conferences-and-events">Getting the most out of conferences and events</a>) that caught my attention because I was about to head off to <a href="http://www.uxsouthafrica.com/">UX South Africa</a>. The bit that I particularly liked was ending each bit of session notes with a To Do item. I like the idea of having and doing something tangible from each session, rather than the more hand-wavy &#8220;I got smarter.&#8221; Here are some of my thoughts and notes from today&#8217;s talks.</p>
<h3 id="anysecondnow">UX in SA: any second now</h3>
<p><strong>Presented by Phil Barrett of <a href="http://www.userexperience.co.za/">Flow</a></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>UX and software takes time, and it&#8217;s an ongoing process. Phil summed this up very nicely by saying: &#8220;<strong>Digital products are soap operas, not movies</strong>.&#8221;</li>
<li>It&#8217;s important to build <strong>prototypes</strong>. Usability testing using them and iterating on them can lead to <strong>breakthroughs</strong>. Breakthroughs can also come from asking &#8220;stupid&#8221; questions.</li>
<li>Phil referred to the market several time during his, talking about how exposure to real users is very useful. &#8220;<strong>Making stuff is the new strategy.</strong>&#8221;</li>
<li>He talked about <strong>changing requirements into assumptions and hypotheses</strong>: doing this provides you with a metric for proving it worked.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To Do</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Look at existing user stories and see about changing them to be more like assumptions and hypotheses.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="theroiofuxdesign">The ROI of UX Design</h3>
<p><strong>Presented by Werner Janse van Rensburg</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Measuring</strong> can justify spending and prove the results of UX work. You can measure effectiveness, efficiency, satisfaction.</li>
<li>The cost of making changes to a product ramps up dramatically as you progress through the Software Development Life Cycle. I think that this is mitigated a little if you&#8217;re using an agile process.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="todo">To Do</h4>
<ul>
<li>Set up measuring of various stats (for my work, that will be Front-end performance and accessibility metrics). Do this first, before making any changes to the system.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="howcanuxworkwithagileteams">How can UX work with agile teams?</h3>
<p><strong>presented by Samantha Laing and Karen Greaves of <a href="http://growingagile.co.za/">Growing Agile</a></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sam &amp; Karen also talked about the market, and <strong>the value of testing with real users in real life</strong> rather than just in the lab. Get feedback from the market, then rework your product.</li>
<li>Do <strong>ongoing, short usability tests</strong>. Spending more time with real users is good for everyone on the team: developers, designers, and everyone in between.</li>
<li>&#8220;Get as close to your user as you can.&#8221; If you can&#8217;t reach the user, but you can talk to someone in customer support: do that.</li>
<li>They also reminded us that in Agile only the the final working product counts as &#8220;done.&#8221; They talked a lot about making slices of pieces of a product.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="todo">To Do</h4>
<ul>
<li>Set up regular, small, usability tests.</li>
</ul>
