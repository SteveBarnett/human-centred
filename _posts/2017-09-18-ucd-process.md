title: UCD Process

I like to iterate on things. When I use something a lot, I tend to iterate on it a lot. Here's the current version of my UCD process.

[![My UCD process: Discover, Design, Make, Measure](/img/ucd-process-700.png)](/img/ucd-process.png)

It still uses the same four steps, but with slightly different names, and a slightly clearer overview.

- Discover: establish the problem.
- Design: choose a solution.
- Make: build a solution.
- Measure: validate a solution.

As I use it, **I keep adjusting it for the kinds of clients that I'm working more (or less) with**. At the moment, I'm mostly working with teams of back-developers. That means it makes sense to have a few more steps in each of the big blocks of Discover, Design, Make, Measure.

**More steps means it's a bit more explicit.** I'm trying not too assume too much existing knowledge about front-end and UX things. **More steps gives us more things to choose from.** Some teams aren't comfortable doing prototypes and wireframes yet. Many teams have large existing applications. In both of these cases, usability testing is a great way to get started in the Design block.

Here are some older versions: [August 2013](/2013/08/28/user-centered-design-process/), [August 2015](/2015/08/20/user-centered-design-process-2/), [August 2016](/2016/08/22/user-centered-design-process-again/). (Apparently this is a good time of year for writing about UCD processes for me!)

I've also added a "business" top and tail for showing to new clients. The very first step is still [the questions about time, scope, and money](https://github.com/SteveBarnett/Client-Questionnaire), then we move on to the Proposal.
