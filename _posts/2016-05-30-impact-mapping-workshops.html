<p>A few weeks ago, I ran two Impact Mapping workshop close together. I'm familiar with the ideas behind them, but I'd never facilitated one before. It was great fun, I learned a lot, and I'm keen to run another one at some point soon.</p>
<p>I've posted <a href="https://github.com/SteveBarnett/Impact-Mapping-Workshop/blob/master/workshop-outline.md">the workshop outline I used, along with the slide decks, on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>You can read more about <a href="https://www.impactmapping.org/">Impact Mapping on the official site</a>. I highly recommend grabbing <a href="https://www.impactmapping.org/book.html">the book</a>. It's a quick read, but packed full of good stuff.</p>
