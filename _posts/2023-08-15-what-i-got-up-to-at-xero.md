Next week is my last week at Xero. I took some time to look back over the past two years and reflect on what I did.

It was something a bit like this...

- **Helped Product, Design, Development, Testing, and Mobile teams meet and exceed WCAG 2.1 to Level AA.** Guided ongoing and iterative accessibility improvement. Helped teams embed accessibility into their processes to make long-term, behavioural, change.
    - Worked on a multidisciplinary team. Initiated, planned, and implemented projects that aligned with strategic goals. Gathered feedback for iterative improvements.
- **Tested with a range of Assistive Technologies.** Screen readers: VoiceOver, NVDA,TalkBack. Voice Control and Voice Access. Zoom on Mac OS, Windows Contrast themes.
    - Conducted usability testing with people with disabilities. Planned and facilitated interviews, compatibility tests, and prototype reviews. Iterated on and retested updated designs.
    - Resolved customer queries. Responded positively to customer problems; directly communicated about their requirements; provided workarounds where necessary.
- **Provided technical HTML, CSS, and JS support as a Front-end Developer.** Supported on Slack and in Pull Requests. Advised on WCAG 2.1 AA compliance and WAI-ARIA.
- **Lead and standardised the audit practice.** Conducted accessibility audits and design reviews. Used technical FED skills to suggest fixes, using the design system. Presented the results. Used aggregated data to inform training and content strategy.
- **Planned and created content.** Used a mix of lengths and formats: written documentation with images; videos; talks; workshops. Repurposed content across delivery methods. Ensured quality by using a framework and requesting peer reviews.
- **Ran training and facilitated events.** Made and ran hands-on, interactive, workshops. Facilitated Q&A sessions and Community of Practice events.
    - Encouraged professional development through learning and growth. Supported varied levels of interest and expertise. Used a mix of practical and theory.

If this sounds a bit like bullet points from a CV... It is!
