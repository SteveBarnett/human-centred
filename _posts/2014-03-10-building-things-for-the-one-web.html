<p>There were a few articles doing the rounds recently that touch on some deep, fundamental, aspects of modern day web development. They had some common themes: <strong>the importance of being flexible</strong> and that <strong>this stuff is hard</strong> (developing for the multi-device world). We&#8217;re still finding our feet, and one area that&#8217;s seeing lots of change is deliverables. </p>
<p>Given the fluid nature of the web, what are the right deliverables for designing and building a web site? How can we show work in progress on a web site without showing the whole, fluid, web site? Whose job is it to decide what we show, how many deliverables there are, and to explain why they&#8217;re different from &#8220;traditional&#8221; deliverables? </p>
<h3 id="continuum">Continuum</h3>
<p><a href="http://adactio.com/journal/6692/">Jeremy Keith&#8217;s Continuum</a> and <a href="http://unstoppablerobotninja.com/entry/platformed/">Ethan Marcotte&#8217;s response: Platformed</a> both discuss the squishiness and universality of the web. Jeremy pointed out that despite the fact that there are differences in browsers and operating systems we can still <strong>support every browser that can connect to the internet</strong> by using a strategy of Progressive Enhancement. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>the unevenly-distributed nature of browser capabilities is not a bug, it’s a feature.<br/><br />
&#8230;<br/><br />
you can provide <strong>universal access to content and tasks without providing exactly the same experience for every single browser or device</strong>. That’s not a failing of the web—that’s its killer app. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>He points out that it&#8217;s our responsibility to explain this diversity of consumption of the web, to educate clients who don&#8217;t understand. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Explaining your design work is part of your design work. It’s the same with web development. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mike Monteiro often talks about this, too: <a href="http://aneventapart.com/news/post/what-clients-dont-know-and-why-its-your-fault-mike-monteiro-an-event-apart/">What Clients Don’t Know (and Why It’s Your Fault)</a>. Ethan added to this, saying that because of the fluid, chaotic, nature of the web as a design medium: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>we play the long game in this business. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The web is <a href="https://naga.co.za/how-i-do-things/#one-web">One Web</a>, and <a href="http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/post/this-is-the-web/">it does (and will) go everywhere that it can</a>. Designing and developing something that&#8217;s pixel-perfect across a small range of <em>today&#8217;s</em> browsers and devices already puts you behind the times. We need to <strong>play the long game and build for the unknown</strong>: well-formed and structured HTML with Progressively Enhanced CSS and JavaScript that lets our sites go anywhere. </p>
<h3 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h3>
<p>The next day I picked up <a href="http://alistapart.com/column/delivery-logistics">Laura Kalbag&#8217;s excellent article: Delivery Logistics</a>, on A List Apart. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In web design, the deliverables we create are rarely the final product; they’re rarely the thing we’re going to “put live” to any users.<br/><br />
&#8230;<br/><br />
We need to stop acting as though deliverables are the be-all and end-all of web design, and <strong>treat them as the communication tool that they are</strong>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is really important. <a href="http://styletil.es/">Style Tiles</a> are an excellent example of this. They provide provide a catalyst for discussions: interface elements without layout, so that we can focus on pieces that make up the design and the layout. <strong>The deliverables along the way are essential to the process</strong>: we&#8217;d never make it to the end, or build the right thing, without things like Personas, Customer Journey Maps, Style Tiles, and so on. We should be treating them more like <strong>signposts to the end product </strong>than the end products in and of themselves, though. </p>
<p>Even the web site (the &#8220;real&#8221; deliverable), once it&#8217;s gone live, is in a state of flux: content gets updated and moves or breaks things; styles get updated for new branding elements. </p>
<h3 id="closingthoughts">Closing thoughts</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s an ongoing process of discovery and learning. One thing I do know is that, as an industry, our tools need to keep changing to keep up. </p>
<p>Building a mobile and a desktop prototype and testing them extensively is great (and very practical), but it&#8217;s important to remember that these are just two <strong>very thin slices of how the site will be experienced</strong>: browsers accessing the web have a lot of dimensions to consider. More on that soon. </p>
<p>Of course there&#8217;s a balance to be had. It&#8217;s impossible to test across every configuration, and impractical to test across large numbers. It&#8217;s also true that many of the lessons learned at these two points on the spectrum can be applied widely. I think that it demonstrates the importance of getting into testing with browsers earlier rather than later, though.</p>
