My approach to helping teams make more accessible products changes over time. Here’s where my focus is at the moment.

## Impact Maps, in general

Quick aside: [impact maps](https://www.impactmapping.org/). They’re great! Roughly speaking, they’re mind maps that go Goal, Actor, Impact, Deliverable. Or, if you prefer: Why, Who, How, What.

## My Impact Map

- An accessible product
	- **Engineers**
		- **Think more broadly.**
			- Use clear, task-oriented, language.
			- Consider what's between the human and the UI. 
		- **Under-engineer more often.**
			- Understand ARIA. Know the [Rules of ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/using-aria/#NOTES).
			- Understand the accessibility tree.
		- **Do more a11y testing, lightly.**
			- Do regular [QACs](http://127.0.0.1:4000/2021/12/13/qac/).
			- Add `axe` in tests.
				- In particular in End-to-end and Integration tests.
	- **Me**
		- **Focus more on solutions, less on problems.**
			- In audits.
			- In support.
		- **Encourage more (accessiblity) champion-like behaviours.**
			- Refer people to other people who've solved this.
			- Ask them to speak at community events (not just Accessibility ones).
		- **Acknowledge and appreciate people's efforts more often.**
			- In support threads.
			- In audit follow-ups.
