<p>The day before the main conference of <a href="http://csforum2012.com/">CS Forum 2012</a>, I attended <a href="http://www.lukew.com/">Luke W</a>'s half day Workshop: <a href="http://csforum2012.com/programme/#multi-device">Multi-device web design</a>. Below are my notes from his excellent talk and Q&amp;A.</p>
<div></div>
<ul>
<li>We need to consider the why and how of mobile and behaviours
<ul>
<li>Lookup / Find: when you need an answer now, possibly related to your location.</li>
<li>Explore / Play: when you have time to kill. Doesn't necessarily mean games.</li>
<li>Check In / Status: something important to you, that has frequent changes.</li>
<li>Edit / Create: Things that must be now, or that you have time to do now.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There's a common feeling that desktop sites are "a giant pile of navigation." Good (mobile) sites have minimal navigation, maximum content.
<ul>
<li>The personalisation is in the filtering of the content.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Speed and performance is more important than ever: mobile is often for while you wait, so you don't want to wait for the content.</li>
<li>Important things remain important (and vice versa), regardless of screen size.</li>
<li>Patterns to consider: nested doll; hub and spoke; bento box; filtered view.</li>
<li>Navigation considerations for smaller screens
<ul>
<li>Look at the balance of navigation / chrome and content on a page.</li>
<li>Rethink UI elements rather than redesign?
<ul>
<li>e.g. search should show results content, not lots of nav or chrome.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Think about how you hold devices
<ul>
<li>Where on the screen is easy to reach, where is hard? Bottom side corners of a touchscreen tend to be comfortable zones.</li>
<li>Posture of user</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The lines between device screen sizes and classifications are blurring. It's becoming a continuum of devices rather than discrete categories. We should treat this as one wide problem rather than lots of small ones.</li>
<li>People tend to prefer a touch interface, when it's available.</li>
<li>For faster sites, avoid images as much as possible.
<ul>
<li>Use icon fonts.</li>
<li>Use SVG (but they can be tricky to implement).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Multi-device design is not just about computing devices: consoles and ereaders have browsers too.</li>
<li>"The mobile stack" of one huge column, content linearised from desktop version, is sub-optimal for mobile: it makes for very long pages.
<ul>
<li>Consider content hierarchy, choreography, emphasis.</li>
<li>A good alternative is the off-canvas layout: to all sides; to either side.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lack of content parity is often the biggest customer complaint.</li>
<li>For shopping and news: the web wins over apps.</li>
<li>One strategy is reduction: do less, but do it better.
<ul>
<li>simple things are easier to push to many places.</li>
<li>but, it can be difficult to sell culturally: e.g. removing the boss's favourite feature.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Think about what comes after mobile.
<ul>
<li>Consumer expectation is to be able to use whatever screen they want to do whatever they want. Multiscreen by default.</li>
<li>Sensors are appearing all over.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ads on the web are terrible and we should ditch them.  There's not big bucks in them anyway.
<ul>
<li>People will pay for experiences, packaging, and related goods or services.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
