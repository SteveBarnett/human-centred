<p>I enjoyed Craig Mod&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2013/12/goodbye-cameras.html">Goodbye, Cameras</a>,&#8221; but his follow up &#8220;<a href="http://craigmod.com/journal/photography_hello/">Photography, Hello</a>&#8221; really got my brain cells jingling. I really enjoy taking photos (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/maximilianbarners/">me on Flickr</a>, <a href="http://instagram.com/maxbarners">me on Instagram</a>). I know I&#8217;m not creating art, but I like to think that some of them come out okay. </p>
<p>I shot film for a few years: everything from full-on SLRs down to flea market finds that just about worked. At the moment, I have a digital SLR that I occasionally use, and the camera on my phone (an iPhone 5). Of the two, I prefer shooting with my SLR. Craig&#8217;s articles got me thinking about why, and about how much the tools I use change the process and the end result. </p>
<h3 id="phonevsslr">Phone vs SLR</h3>
<p>I find that I&#8217;m taking quite a few pictures on my phone these days, but that&#8217;s partly to do with opportunity. When I was working from home, I would have time to go out on photo missions during the day. Now that I have regular working hours in an office, it&#8217;s only every few weekends that I manage to get together with my photo geek buddies and haul out my SLR; I always have my phone on me, though. </p>
<p>Posting more photos from my phone hasn&#8217;t been the result of the rise in the quality of the lenses. I don&#8217;t mind rough edges: I like lens flares, film shots with light leaks, and so on. It&#8217;s much more about being connected and therefore having greatly reduced friction of sharing and publishing. </p>
<p>With the phone I find myself having lower standards about what&#8217;s good enough, and I think that&#8217;s partly because it&#8217;s so easy to share. My SLR is not networked, so the process of sharing pictures is slower and more deliberate. I&#8217;m forced into having time and space to review the pictures I&#8217;ve taken before publishing them: I review them later, hopefully more objectively and with a harsher eye. I usually only post a handful of pictures from each photo outing even though I usually take a double-digit number of pictures. </p>
<h3 id="toolschangingtheprocess">Tools changing the process</h3>
<p>Using the SLR feels physically different. Taking photos is more paced, structured, and considered. Using a different tool changes the process quite dramatically, and I think it changes the kinds of pictures I take as a result. Of course, I can do <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/maximilianbarners/6709944979/in/photosof-maximilianbarners/">silly selfie snaps</a> on either, but I&#8217;m much more likely to do so with my phone. A <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/maximilianbarners/4222649768/">wide shot of the mountain</a> can be taken on either, but I&#8217;m more likely to take one when I&#8217;m carrying around my SLR. Perhaps this says more about me than it does about the tools, but it's made me look at what tools I use to build sites, and how they might be influencing how and what I do.</p>
