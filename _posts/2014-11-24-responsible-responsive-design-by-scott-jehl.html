<p>This weekend, I tore through the excellent <a href="http://www.abookapart.com/products/responsible-responsive-design">Responsible Responsive Design</a> by the crazy-smart <a href="http://scottjehl.com/">Scott Jehl</a>, the latest from A Book Apart. It's a great read, and a succint summary of some new (focus on performance) and not so new (do Progressive Enhancement) ideas and themes that are bouncing around Front-end web dev land.</p>
<p>I've been having fun trying out <a href="http://sketchnotearmy.com/">sketchnoting</a> things, rather than my previous technique of trying to scribble down every single word of something. I'm particularly interested to see if it helps my memory, which at the moment is terrible. Here are my sketchnotes form the book. Click a pic for a larger version.</p>
