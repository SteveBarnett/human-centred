<summary>Text version of sketchnotes for “Build confidence with tests – Helen Kyryliuk”</summary>

<ul>
	<li>Tests
	<ul>
		<li>Make sure code <strong>works</strong></li>

		<ul>
			<li>Static, Unit, Integration, End to End</li>
			<li><a href="https://kentcdodds.com/blog/write-tests">“Write tests. Not too many. Mostly integration.”</a></li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The more out test are like <strong>user behaviour</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>the more <strong>confidence</strong> we can have</li>
			<li>the less frequently the tests change (because they aren’t tied to implementation)</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<details>
<summary>Text version of sketchnotes for “Building a culture of experimentation – Gareth Bradley”</summary>

			<li>To improve or optimise</li>
			<li>Time is expensive</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Why have a culture of experimentation?</li>
		<ul>
			<li>It’s part of a high-performing team</li>
			<li>It’s <strong>fun</strong> to be scrapped sometimes</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Look at what got better <strong>and</strong> what got worse.</li>
</ul>
</details>

<li>Thoughts
	<ul>

		<li>I’m not smart enough</li>
		<li>I’m not fast enough</li>
		<li>Am I a “real” developer?</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>The problems are often (inter)personal, not tech</li>
<li>A sense of <strong>belonging</strong> is very important.</li>
</ul>
</details>

## My talk

Also! I did a tiny ten minute lightning talk: “D&D and Accessibility”.

- Here are [the slides from the talk](https://speakerdeck.com/stevebarnett/d-and-d-and-accessibility).
- Here’s [the original blog post where I thought of this (silly) idea](https://naga.co.za/2022/05/15/dungeons-and-dragons-and-accessibility/).
