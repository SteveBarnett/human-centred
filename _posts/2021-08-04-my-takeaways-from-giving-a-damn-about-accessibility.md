I recently got around to reading [Sheri Byrne-Haber](https://sheribyrnehaber.medium.com/)'s very excellent ["Giving A Damn About Accessibility" handbook](https://uxdesign.cc/giving-a-damn-about-accessibility-6caf90be5a40). Here are some of my key takeaways.

- Discriminating against People with Disabilities (PwD) is ableist and unethical. "Is it okay to make software that [any given group] can't use?" No!
- Saying inaccessible software only impacts a small number of users is emotional compensation for an ethics violation.
- "PwD aren't part of our target market" is a circular logical fallacy.
- Not fixing things now builds up accessibility debt since the standards are becoming more complex, detailed, and strict.
- How do we solve this problem?
  - Reward employees for releasing accessible software.
  - Have more PwD involved in the process.
  - Solicit vocal executive support.

### Ways to approach people who don't give a damn

One of my favourite frameworks for thinking about behaviour change is outlined in [the Heath Brothers book Switch](https://heathbrothers.com/books/switch/). They talk about three areas to consider: the Rider (the rational); the Elephant (the emotional); the Path (the environment). Different problems require different approaches.

In Sheri's handbook, she highlights six types of people who don't give a damn. Here's a list of the types and a Switch-based way of approaching them. Some of the ideas are interchangable and work for multiple types!

- **The type:** the people who are allergic to change. **An approach:** Remind them of changes bigger than this that they've already made.
- **The type:** the people who want to see “the business case.” **An approach:** Create empathy by showing the problem with not changing.
- **The type:** the people who want to see detailed proof for every accessibility recommendation. **An approach:** simplify the problem by scripting the critical moves.
- **The type:** the people who prioritize the creation of inaccessible new features over making old features accessible. **An approach:** shrink the change. Make it so small they can't say no.
- **The type:** the people who believe “well, it only impacts a small number of users.” **An approach:** tweak the environment so that whether they see the need to change or not is irrelevant.
- **The type:** the people who don’t believe that disabled people are part of the product’s target audience/demographic/customers. **An approach:** highlight how it matches (or conflicts) with their sense of identity.
