<p>Since moving to running OSX (from Ubuntu, from Windows), I've been using <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2">Sublime Text 2</a> as my editor of choice. It's the best editor I've worked with, and I can't imagine having to switch from it. One off the great things about it is that there's always more to learn about it, and last week I finally got around to watching<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZ-bgcJ6fQo">Â Perfect Workflow in Sublime Text 2</a>. Here are a few quick things that I picked up from the video(s).</p>
<ul>
<li>Ctrl + Cmd + G expands the selection to all instances in the open file (like a big Cmd + D)</li>
<li>I should be using Cmd + Shift + P (even) more often. It lets you access almost everything.</li>
<li>Cmd + R, Goto Symbol, is a very useful in-page find.
<ul>
<li>Cmd + P, then @, lets you open a file and Goto Symbol.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I should start using the gist Package (which you can install via <a href="http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control">Package Control</a>).</li>
</ul>
