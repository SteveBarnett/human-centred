[JAFAC](https://www.jafac.nz/) was really great! It's given me lots to think about it, and I have many pages of notes and TODOs.

I really felt like "these are my people". Agile folk, mostly coaches. People who put people first and understand that a company, more than anything else, is its people. 

Below are just my sketchnotes of the talks: just half of the conference and not nearly half of all the ideas that I have!

## Day one
