I’m gathering ideas for how to reward / celebrate teams doing well at accessibility. Here are some starter, rough, notes.

## Why celebrate

- Feedback on the outcome of actions is important.
- Progress towards clear goals is rewarding. 
- Humans are social animals. Social proof, social herding, and the availability heuristic can help others do the right thing too. Social context gives value to numbers.
    - Co-operation is a more powerful motivator than competition. It allows for reciprocity. It helps feeling like we’re part of something bigger and that we're helping others.

## When to celebrate

- Reward immediately for success, progress, choices. Humans are better are short-term things.

## What to celebrate

- Behaviours. They’re leading, not lagging, measures. 
- Improvements. Compare to what others have done, and to our own past performance.
    - Not all places are evenly spaced: first and last are much heavier. 
    - Non-contingent rewards (aka participation awards) can help balance things when people aren’t doing so well.
- Achieving a milestone. They’re inherently motivating. They must be something worth celebrating: something that takes weeks or months to do.

## How to celebrate

- It must be clear that it is a reward, what it’s for, and why it’s worth having.
- Rewards that are meaningful and personalised are more motivating.
    - Praise and pride. Short, specific, praise.
    - Promote a growth mindset. Praise the effort, not the outcome.
    - Make it emotionally positive. “Turn up the volume.”
- More time / cost / effort spent means people expect a bigger / better reward.

### Indirectly

- Allow for insight: clear, compressed in time, discovered by the person themselves.
