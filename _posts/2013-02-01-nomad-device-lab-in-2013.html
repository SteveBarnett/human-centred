<p>At the end of last year I was running one session of <a href="http://devicelab.co.za/">the lab</a> a week, at various locations around town: Bandwidth Barn in Woodstock; Information Logistics in Century City; Unboxed Consulting in Constantia; Flow in Claremont. The testing and fixing was great fun, and it was good to be moving around town and meeting new people. However, all the driving around made things quite difficult for me, especially after taking a full-time job.</p>
<p>This year the lab has a permanent home at <a href="http://www.unboxedconsulting.com/">Unboxed</a> Cape Town, where I'm working. Anyone is welcome to come and test on the devices: please <strong>drop me a line</strong> to <a class="email" href="mailto:nomad@devicelab.co.za">nomad@devicelab.co.za</a> to arrange an appointment. I hope to still do some travelling sessions, but with a slightly different twist. Something that interests me is taking the lab to a conference or meetup, to get the word out about the lab and to do some quick and dirty testing.</p>
<p>In related news, The lab is featured on the newly launched <a href="http://opendevicelab.com/#!odl=214">Open Device Lab.com</a>: a central resource for Open Device Labs across the world.</p>
