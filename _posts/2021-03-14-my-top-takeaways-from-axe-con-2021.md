Last week I took some days off and (virtually) attended [axe-con](https://www.deque.com/axe-con/), Deque's conference for building accessible experiences. I picked a few talks to watch and made sketchnotes.

I usually learn a lot from conferences. The problem for me tends to be trimming the list down to something actionable and achievable ðŸ˜¬. For axe-con, I've picked three things to do:

- Counter "we don't have time to cater to special needs" by focusing on the **core human need**. E.g. "Eating is not a special need!"
- Make an **a11y Acceptance Criteria library** (maybe using the Given / When / Then format).
- Use the **coach** model instead of the **Subject Matter Expert** model: it implies teaching and training, and **transferring of skills**.

## Day one

Here are my sketchnotes:

## Day two

Here are my sketchnotes:
