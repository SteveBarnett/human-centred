<p>As part of research for something I'm working on, I plucked out some statistics for mobile vs desktop for the world, and for South Africa. The numbers below are a guide to the state of play as at January 2014. The mobile / desktop split is a bit of a false dichotomy, but it's a useful shorthand for small things vs big things, new things vs old things.</p>
<p><strong>Worldwide</strong> web usage is about <strong>24% mobile vs 76% desktop</strong>. In <strong>South Africa</strong>, it’s more like <strong>63% mobile vs 37% desktop</strong>. The tipping point (when it was 50 / 50) was around October 2013. It's important to remember that many users in SA are mobile-only: they don’t have access to a desktop computer with an internet connection.</p>
<p>In terms of the split of operating systems, the largest is BlackBerry with about 34%. Android is at about 20%, as is Series 40 (Nokia’s featurephone operating system). Symbian (Nokia’s newer OS) is about 6%, and Apple’s iOS is at about 4%.</p>
<p>Blackberry and Nokia are the handset leaders, but Samsung is also popular, taking around 15% of the handsets in SA.</p>
