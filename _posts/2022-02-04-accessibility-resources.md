Here are some handy accessibility links.

For checking against WCAG specifically, I find the Quick Reference version most readable: [How to Meet WCAG (Quick Reference)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?currentsidebar=%23col_overview&levels=aaa&technologies=smil%2Cpdf%2Cflash%2Csl) (with filters set to: include Level A and AA; exclude SMIL, PDF, Flash, and Silverlight).

Also great is [Intopia's Accessibility Not-Checklist](https://not-checklist.intopia.digital/)
