<p>Microsoft (MS) has just announced <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/End-of-IE-support">end of support for older versions of Internet Explorer</a>. As usual, there are a few cries of joy from the dev community. And as usual, I don&rsquo;t feel like this is such a big deal.</p>
<h3 id="usage-versus-official-support">Usage versus Official Support</h3>
<p>One reason is: <strong>just because MS stops supporting it, it doesn&rsquo;t that mean people will stop using it</strong>. Some people are unable to upgrade their browser (because of technology or administrative constraints), some people don&rsquo;t want to, and some people don&rsquo;t know about other browsers.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/#all-os-ww-monthly-201412-201512">StatCounter puts global Windows XP users at about 5%</a>: that&rsquo;s still something like 350 million people using an old version of the browser, and being unable to upgrade (since the Operating System is unable to use a newer version).</p>
<p>Eventually these stats will drop to zero, but it will take a while.</p>
<h3 id="feature-based-support--not-browser-based-support">Feature-based support, not browser-based support</h3>
<p>More importantly, building with Progressive Enhancement (PE) means that we&rsquo;re more interested in <strong>the features our web things are using than the browsers that are accessing it</strong>. If we were trying to make things look identical everywhere, we might be worried, but we&rsquo;re not (see <a href="http://dowebsitesneedtolookexactlythesameineverybrowser.com/">No</a> and <a href="http://dowebsitesneedtobeexperiencedexactlythesameineverybrowser.com/">Nope</a>).</p>
<p>We support all browsers, enhance the experience for fancier browsers, and spend a bit more time and optimise for the browsers our audience use.</p>
<p>I feel kind of the same about an announcement of end of support for a browser as I do about the announcement of a new browser: &ldquo;that&rsquo;s nice, but I don&rsquo;t really have to update my (Progressively Enhanced) code for that.&rdquo;</p>
