Summary: if it's for navigation, use a link; if it's for an action, use a button. Then use CSS to make it look like the designs.

Using the right element for the job is not just about doing the right thing for users of assistive tech like screen readers. It's also about ease of understanding and readability of the code (is it clear what this thing does?) and consistent and clear UX for all users (what will happen when I click / tab / space this?).

Jeremy Keith calls it [material honesty](https://resilientwebdesign.com/chapter2/): using the right element lets users know what to expect. For example: if it looks like a link, I should be able to open it in a new tab, copy the address or bookmark it for later. You can't do that with a bookmark.

## Red flags

A few things that stop me in my tracks and make me ask questions.

- Adding a `tabindex="0"` to make an element focusable. Can you use a focusable element like an `a` or a `button` instead?
- Adding a `role="button"` or `role="link"`. Can you use a `button` or `a` element instead?
- Using a `div` or a `span` for an element that does an action like navigation or show / hde. Can you use an `a` or a `button` instead?
- Using `href="#"` on an `a` (i.e. a link that goes nowhere). Can you use a button instead?
- Using `disabled` on an `a`. That's not a valid attribute on an `a`. Can you use a button instead?

You can make a `div` or a `span` into a link or a button by adding a `role`, `tabindex="0"`, and handlers for click, <kbd>Space</kbd>, <kbd>Enter</kbd> events. But you're making more work for yourself, so please just use an `a` or a `button` instead! ðŸ˜…

## Links

Links are used to navigate the user to a new page or view or bit of a page: to move away from current context. They:

- are focusable by default when they have an `href` attribute (no need to add a `tabindex`);
- respond with a click event to the <kdb>Enter</kdb> key;
- can't be disabled (they can be made inert with `tabindex="-1"` and `aria-hidden="true"`, but be sure that's what you need);
- accept `:link`, `:visited`, `:focus`, `:hover`, `:active` styles;
- are communicated as links to screen readers (no need to add `role="link"`)

```html
<!-- yes! -->
<a href="/profile">View your profile</a>
<a href="/profile">Profile <img src="/icons/profile.png" alt="" /></a>
<a href="/profile" aria-label="View your Profile"><img src="/icons/profile" alt="" /></a>

<!-- please no -->
<a href="#">Click here</a> <!-- link goes nowhere. should be a button? -->
<a href="#" title="Click here">Click here</a> <!-- title is redundant -->
<a href="/profile" role="link">Click here</a> <!-- role="link" is redundant -->
<a href="/profile" tabindex="0">Click here</a> <!-- tabindex="0" is redundant -->
<span role="link" tabindex="0" href="/profile">click here</a> <!-- faking a link instead of using a link -->
```

### Link Do's

- Do add `alt` text to an image that's the content of an `a`.
- Do make sure links are visually distinct from the surrounding text.
- Do make sure `:focus` styles are clear and distinct from the regular styles.
- Do try and make link text unique on the page. This benefits users of assistive tech and makes for better UX.
- Do add `aria-current="page"` to the `a` in a nav list, if it's the current page.

### Link Don'ts

- Don't add a `title` attribute: use the text of the link instead.
- Don't wrap chunks of content in an `a`, even though it's technically allowed in the spec. Screen readers read the whole chunk of content as the content of the link (rather than the more appropriate "Read the rest of this article.")
- Don't use a link with `href="#"`. You should probably be using a button in that case! ðŸ˜…

## Buttons

Buttons are for Doing Things like submitting forms or showing and hiding things.

- A `button` inside a `form` has an implicit `type="submit"` (no need to add it).
- Other buttons should have a `type="button"` to avoid automagically submitting a form.

They:

- receive keyboard focus by default (no need to add `tabindex`);
- respond with a click event to the <kdb>Space</kdb> key or <kdb>Enter</kdb> key;
- can be disabled with the `disabled` attribute;
- are communicated as buttons to screen readers (no need to add `role="button"`);
- accept `:focus`, `:hover`, `:active`, `:disabled` styles.

```html
<!-- yes! -->
<button type="button">Show messages</button>
<button type="button">
  Show messages <img src="/icons/messages.png" alt="" />
</button>
<button type="button">
  <img src="/icons/messages.png" alt="Show messages" />
</button>
<button
  type="button"
  disabled
  aria-describedby="id-of-a-paragraph-explaining-why"
>
  Show messages
</button>

<!-- please no -->
<button type="button"><img src="/icons/messages.png" /></button>
<!-- no accessible name -->
<button type="button"><div>Show messages</div></button>
<!-- divs aren't valid inside buttons -->
```

### Button Do's

- Do always provide an accessible name. - Put text inside the button. If there's also an image, that can have `alt=""`. - Use an `aria-label` on the `button` **or** `alt` text on the image if the image is the only thing inside the `button`.
- Do make the accessible name describe the action that will occur when the user hits the button. Ideally it should be unique too: "Show messages" rather than just "Show". This benefits users of assistive tech and makes for better UX.
- Do have an explanation why if you make a `button` disabled. Use `aria-describedby` to point at the ID of the element containing the explanation.

### Button Don'ts

- Don't add `div`s as children elements of a `button`. But you can add inline things like `span`s.
