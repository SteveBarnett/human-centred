<p><a href="http://www.google.com/doodles/john-venns-180th-birthday">Today&#8217;s google doodle</a> is for John Venn&#8217;s 180th birthday. I did maths at university, and a love of numbers and stats and things has stayed with me. Since I&#8217;m a fan of charts and graphs, and Venn diagrams in particular, I decided to make a little one today. </p>
<p>At first, I wanted to do more flag waving and shouting about <a href="https://naga.co.za/2014/03/12/responsive-web-design/">responsive web design</a> and the <a href="https://naga.co.za/2014/03/10/building-things-for-the-one-web/">One Web</a>, but when I started sketching things out, I realised that it&#8217;s actually kind of complicated, and has a number of criss-crossing dimensions. That means it doesn&#8217;t fit Venn Diagrams too well. Instead, I want to show where I think Front-end developers live in the world of the web, using a somewhat simplified picture. </p>

<p><strong>Back-end developers</strong> (BED) do all the behind-the-scenes stuff that makes a web site run, like Databases and APIs and things. </p>
<p><strong>Designers</strong> do all the to-the-human stuff that makes a web site work well, like visuals, user experience, and things. </p>
<p><strong>Front-end developers</strong> (FED) sit somewhere between the two. They have some design and interaction skills, and they have some coding skills. More importantly, they provide a bridge between the very tech-y side and the very design-y. They can speak bits of both languages, so they&#8217;re able to translate between the two. </p>
<h3>Mix it up</h3>
<p>I&#8217;m a strong believer in cross-functional teams: having a mix of skills and levels of tech and design skills across a team makes everyone smarter, better at being part of the team, and better at their jobs. I think that working with back-end developers and designers gives front-end developers a wider context to what they&#8217;re doing, and it helps them skill up. I certainly find this to be true for me. It goes both ways, of course: learning a little about front-end development makes back-end developers better at their job and designers better at theirs.</p>
<p>I hope to expand on this in the talk I'm giving at the <a href="http://www.uxsouthafrica.com/">UX South Africa conference</a> in a few weeks time. Eek!</p>
