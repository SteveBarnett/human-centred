<p>The most recent issue of A List Apart has two excellent, must read, articles:<br />
<a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/the-best-browser-is-the-one-you-have-with-you/" title="The Best Browser is the One You Have with You on A List Apart">The Best Browser is the One You Have with You</a> by Stephanie Rieger;<br />
<a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/for-a-future-friendly-web/" title="For a Future-Friendly Web">For a Future-Friendly Web</a> by Brad Frost.</p>
<p>A word of warning, though: set aside at least half an hour for these. Good stuff, worth digesting, including the many, many, links contained therein.</p>
