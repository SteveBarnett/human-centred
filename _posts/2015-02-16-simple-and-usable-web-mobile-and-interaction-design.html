<p>I recently jumped through Giles Colborne's book "<a href="http://www.simpleandusable.com/">Simple and usable</a>: web, mobile, and interaction design." Although I found some parts of the book felt a little dated (it was released in 2010), there are some excellent product and user experience bits of advice in there.</p>
<p>I picked up Mr Colborne's book hoping to find some ideas and inspiration for simplifying the user interface and experience of Vumi Go, and I wasn't disappointed. Vumi Go is the web app that lets people set up <a href="http://vumi.org/">Vumi</a> conversations. It's a bit of a beast: it gives you access to a lot of the powerful things that Vumi can do with its messaging services, but they're complicatedly intertwined with each other.</p>
<p>We've already made some Trello cards for acting on one of the strategies for simplification: removing. Specifically: tidying up the code and interface by removing broken bits and pieces that seem to have kept hanging on.</p>
<p>Here are my sketchnotes from the book.</p>
