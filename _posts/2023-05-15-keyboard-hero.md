[Global Accessibility Awareness Day](https://accessibility.day/) is on Thursday, May 18, 2023. It’s the 12th GAAD!. This year, I'm focusing on the keyboard.


<div class="boxout">
<p><strong>🦸 Be a hero</strong></p>

<p>Making things work well with the keyboard is <strong>good for usability</strong> and <strong>essential for accessibility</strong>. The best part is that we don’t need any special equipment to start testing!</p>
</div>

Here are some light-hearted accessibility activities to have a go at.

- [🐭 vs 🎹 Mouse vs Keyboard](#mouse-vs-keyboard). Have a bit of think about who uses a mouse or keyboard, why, when, and how.
- [🕹️ Shall We Play A Game?](#shall-we-play-a-game) Do a bit of Tab-ing around to uncover some keyboard tricks (not treats).
- [📺 Go a little wider](#go-a-little-wider). Watch some videos covering broader topics about disability.

</div>

## 🐭 vs 🎹 Mouse vs Keyboard
{: #mouse-vs-keyboard }

Spoilers! Many people use a mix of mouse and keyboard. What they use can change with content and context.

### At one end: 100% mouse 🐭 (or trackpad. Also know as “👉” (pointer)).

- Who always uses a mouse?
- Who never uses a physical keyboard?
	- Might they might be using an on-screen keyboard or voice control?

<div class="boxout">
<p><strong>🦸 Be a hero</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>In your browser, go to a bit of UI you’ve worked on recently.</li>
	<li>Does it work with mouse only (except for bits that require typing in data)?</li>
</ul>
</div>

### At the other end: 100% keyboard 🎹

- Who always uses the keyboard?
- Who never uses the mouse?

Why is that?

<div class="boxout">
<p><strong>🦸 Be a hero</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>In your browser, go to a bit of UI you’ve worked on recently.</li>
	<li>Does it work with keyboard only?</li>
</ul>
</div>

### Where do these fine folk sit on the line from all-🐭 to all-🎹?

Hint: This stuff is on a spectrum. Many people use a mix!

Someone who…

- is a “Power user”
- is on old technology, that works… intermittently
- has an injury to their dominant arm
- is a bit older and has less precise motor control
- has arthritis
- has Low Vision
- is on a smartphone
- is… You! 🫵

How does the experience change if you slide towards the other end of the scale?

## 🕹️ Shall We Play A Game?
{: #shall-we-play-a-game }

Fancy a bit of spooky fun? Check out [Hocus Focus](https://focus.hteumeuleu.com/), a keyboard accessibility horror game. It’s 8 levels of Halloween-themed keyboard trickery to daze and amaze.

It’s a slightly silly simulation of common (keyboard-related) web accessibility issues, like:

- focus styles (can I see where I am?)
- logical order (am I moving in reading order?) (left to right, top to bottom, in English)
- keyboard traps (can I reach everywhere on the page?)

Psst! If you want a hint for level 7: try using your Shift key too!

<div class="boxout">
<p><strong>🦸 Be a hero</strong></p>

For each level:

<ul>
<li>Have a think about who might this “trick, not treat” affect?</li>
<li>In your browser, go to a bit of UI you’ve worked on recently. Does this level’s “trick, not treat” happen anywhere?</li>
</ul>
</div>

### A bit more about games and accessibility

Check out [Difficulty Vs Accessibility](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPehhHZvKE8) (video, 6m3s). In it, Ian Hamilton talks about how:

- difficulty is capability vs barrier;
- disability is mismatched interactions between capability and barrier;
- accessibility is avoiding unnecessary mismatches


## 📺 Go a little wider
{: #go-a-little-wider }

Check out [Web Accessibility Perspectives: Keyboard Compatibility](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93UgG72os8M) (video, 47s) for more on keyboards and accessiblity.

Want to learn more about assistive technology is general? Check out one of these:

- [Assistive Technology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBxmADjQlI4) (video, 1m42s). A high-level overview of AT.
- [Assistive Technology in Action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g95TO20hnmo) - Meet Elle (3m40s) showing DynaVox, a look-to-talk bit of AT.
- [Assistive Technology in Action - Meet Jared](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhj5vs9P5cw). (video, 3m55s). Jared, a young man with cerebral palsy who, with the help of AT, is able to control his entire computer and run his graphic arts business through a sip and puff switch.

## 🛑 Tab… stop!
{: #tab-stop }

Oh, you’re still here? You want an advanced activity? 🤔

Well, try this out.

<div class="boxout">
<p><strong>🦸 Be a(n advanced) hero</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>In your browser, go to a bit of UI you’ve worked on recently.</li>
	<li>(Using just the keyboard) How many keystrokes does it take to complete the main task?
		<ul>
			<li>Don’t worry about counting keystrokes for typing words.</li>
			<li>Only count interaction keystrokes: `Tab`, Arrow keys (`↑`, `→`, `↓`, `←`), `Space`, `Enter`.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>How long does it take compared to using mouse and keyboard?</li>
</ul>
</div>

## 🦸 (Keep) Be(ing) a hero

Good work. Don’t stop now! Be a Keyboard Hero tomorrow, and the next day, and the next. ❤️ 

- Think a little more who uses the keyboard.
- Testing a little with the keyboard. (Check out the Keyboard section of the QAC for more!)
- Keep learning a little more about how different humans use different technology.
