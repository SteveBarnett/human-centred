<p>It's a very exciting time in the world of web development, particularly in terms of <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/">responsive design</a>.<br />
After a bit of backwards and forwards, I've decided to release a new design for this site, and do something a bit experimental.</p>
<p>The site runs on <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>, using a custom-made <strong>Naga</strong> Theme built with HTML5 and has some CSS3 features, with more to come as I continue to tweak the design. The Naga Theme is a <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes">Child Theme</a> based on another custom-made one: <a href="http://174.120.62.98/~naga/wp-content/themes/toolbox-hardboilerplated-0.93.zip">Toolbox Hardboilerplated</a> (zip, 113KB). This is something I'm working on in an attempt to have a <a href="http://hardboiledwebdesign.com/">Hardboiled</a> Theme based on a number of other excellent projects. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/toolbox">WordPress Toolbox Theme</a>;</li>
<li><a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/">HTML5 Boilerplate</a>;</li>
<li><a href="http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/projects/320andup/">320 and up</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The site adapts its shape to a one, two, or three column layout depending on the size of screen that it's being viewed on. Everything is done with ems and percentages, so the site expands and contracts into the available space.<br />
Resize your browser window to see it in action.</p>
<p>Other bits of interest:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fonts are served by <a href="http://typekit.com/">Typekit</a>: <a href="http://typekit.com/fonts/le-monde-courrier-std">Le Monde Courrier</a> for body text and <a href="http://typekit.com/fonts/news-gothic-std">News Gothic</a> for titles;</li>
<li>The contact details at the bottom of each page are <a href="http://microformats.org/">microformatted</a> as an <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard">hCard</a>;</li>
<li>Blog posts are marked up in compliance with the <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hnews">hNews</a> microformat.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'd love to hear your thoughts about the new look!</p>
