<p>Yesterday I just about managed to finished all the bits and bobs that I wanted to for Dicey Devices. There are lots of things I’d like to improve about it, of course. It was a fun experiment, and I might like to look at it more seriously again later.</p>
<h3>What I did finish</h3>
<p><a href="http://stevebarnett.github.io/DiceyDevices/">Dicey Devices</a> takes six icons and throws randomly on to a 3 x 2 grid, then applies a couple of filters and transformations to them, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>stretching the devices horizontally and / or vertically, by a little or a lot;</li>
<li>apply a 3d twist to them left or right, by a little or a lot;</li>
<li>colouring them in;</li>
<li>by mimicking bad or old screens by fading, desaturating, blurring, darkening, or showing a crack on the screen;</li>
<li>super secret "night-mode”.</li>
</ul>
<p>The site being previewed can be fed in using a query string like so: <a href="http://stevebarnett.github.io/DiceyDevices/?url=example.com">?url=example.com</a></p>
<h3>What I didn’t finish / room for improvement</h3>
<ul>
<li>I used <a href="http://www.h5bp.com">h5bp</a> for my HTML template, so there are bits there I should strip out: stray js files and classes.</li>
<li>jQuery is included, but is not necessary: the only bit I use it for is <a href="https://github.com/SteveBarnett/DiceyDevices/blob/gh-pages/js/main.js#L84">looping through two arrays</a>.</li>
<li>modernizr is included, but not used.</li>
<li>Simplifying the maths. I’m sure I ran myself around in circles with the SASS calcs for positioning.</li>
<li>Randomising the sizes of the devices.</li>
<li>To add the cracked screens effects, I added an extra div: this breaks scrolling in the iframe.</li>
<li>Fitting it to the screen.</li>
</ul>
