<p>One of the things that <a href="http://yiibu.com/">Yiibu</a> are very good at it is making presentations about important things: mobile first, progressive enhancement, and all that good stuff. Their latest, <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/yiibu/the-emerging-global-web">The Emerging Global Web</a>, has some excellent and eye-opening information about Asia in particular. </p>
<p>The bits that I found particularly good had something in common: they&#8217;re all useful as refutations of &#8220;lower income people (usually on featurephones) don&#8217;t spend money using the web.&#8221; Yiibu&#8217;s presentations shows how people in China and Thailand are using a combination of Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp, and WeChat to run their business. Not only that, but their business is a combination of an informal physical shop and an online shop. This combination is particularly good for rural businesses who can&#8217;t or won&#8217;t have a physical, heavy, bricks-and-mortar shop. </p>
<p>The presentation also provides a good reminder that we should be building for the future. A particular example they use is China, and its middle class that is growing very fast. This is already an important market, and will become more so as time goes on. </p>
<p>Last but not least: it looks like all the QR codes in the world have run away to China!</p>
