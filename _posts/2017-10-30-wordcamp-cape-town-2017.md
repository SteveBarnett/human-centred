Last year I co-ran a [workshop on Front-end performance](https://2016.capetown.wordcamp.org/session/front-end-performance/) at WordCamp. This year I was lucky enough to be accepted again. [Nicola du Toit](http://nicoladutoit.com/) and I ran a [workshop on Inclusive Design](https://2017.capetown.wordcamp.org/session/inclusive-design-more-heart-%E2%9D%A4-more-humans-2/) (and accessibility).

We made the workshop very interactive. There was only a little bit of us talking and a lot of attendees **doing stuff**. The content of the workshop borrowed a lot from the [Global Accessibility Awareness Day (GAAD) workshop](https://ctfeds.github.io/Global-Accessibility-Awareness-Day-2017/) that I help run every year for the [CTFEDs](http://ctfeds.org/) (Cape Town Front-End Developers) [meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/ctfeds/). It's a bunch of activities that help us gain more empathy for people visiting our sites and apps who aren't like us.

We also tried to emphasise the idea of disability as a continuum: it's (just) about completely blind users, it's also about users with poor eyesight, or users who are on an old monitor, or who are outside on a sunny day.

To make the 90 minute workshop, we took the existing GAAD activities, added some new ones, and spent a lot of time making the activity cards. We wanted attendees to be clear on:

- what to do;
- things to check;
- why to do it;
- things they could change.

Here are the resources (as a google doc) that we provided to workshop attendees: [bit.ly/emplab100](//bit.ly/emplab100). That has links out to the workshop activities ([bit.ly/emplab101](//bit.ly/emplab101)), our slide deck ([bit.ly/emplab102](//bit.ly/emplab102)), and the bingo board  ([bit.ly/emplab103](//bit.ly/emplab103)) that we gave people to track their progress.

The workshop was great fun and we got some very positive feedback from attendees. I'm planning to use this as a base for next year's CTFEDS GAAD workshop. I hope to be back at WordCamp again next year!
