description: Disability isn't binary - it's a spectrum.

One of the biggest challenges of convincing people to do accessibility is that it's **necessary**. It's easy to say "they're not our target market." People with disabilities do use our sites and apps, though, even if we don't know about them.

An aspect of this thinking that's hard to change is that **disability isn't binary: it's a spectrum**. Changing from seeing something as an on/off switch to a long line of possiblities is a big jump. So I started thinking: how about taking it from 2 dots (has a disability, doesn't have a disability) to 3 dots (has a disability, doesn't have a disability, and one point in-between). After that it might be easier to add another dot (and another, and another, ...).

### Turning this idea into an activity

At [the end of last year](/community/#workshops-2017), (my friend and fellow UX person) [Nicola du Toit](http://nicoladutoit.com/) and I started what we hope to be a series of workshops on Inclusive Design. We ran one at the [UX South Africa](http://uxsouthafrica.com/) conference (where [I played the role of MC again](/2017/09/26/preparing-for-mc-ing/)) and one at [WordCamp Cape Town](https://2017.capetown.wordcamp.org/session/inclusive-design-more-heart-%E2%9D%A4-more-humans-2/).

The workshops are very hands-on: you **do stuff** when you come to one our workshops! So I started thinking about an activity we could do at one of those workshops. Something to help people start thinking about 3 dots instead of 2 dots. Here's my first draft of the activity.

#### Three dots activity

1. Write down a one line description of someone who you think is **not** in your target market of users, because of a severe disability they have. This disability might affect their eyes, their hands, or their brain. Let's call them person A.
  - (Example: a person with a severe visual disability.)
2. Let's say the disability of person A is 5/5 in terms of severity. Now imagine someone with a similar disability (the same category of eyes, hands, or brain) at a 1/5 severity. Write a one line description of them. Let's call them person B.
  - (Example: someone who forgot their reading glasses.)
3. What are some ideas for changes could you make to your stuff to help person B?
  - (Example: check and adjust the contrast of your text and background colours.)
4. Would that also help person A?
    - If yes, how? (Also: that's great! `\o/`)
    - If no, what additional small change might you have to make so that it would?

### Coming soon

I'm hoping we'll get to try this activity at the next run of our Inclusive Design workshop.

If you have five minutes, why not try this activity yourself? What did you think of it? Did it help you think about three dots instesd of two? :)
