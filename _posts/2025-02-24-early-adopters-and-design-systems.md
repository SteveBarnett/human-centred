I'm working on a project with a design system early in its life. I thought that keeping in mind some qualities of Early Adopters could be useful in terms of adoption of the DS (Design System).

I'm using "Early Adopter" here to mean someone who uses something new and innovative before the mainstream population does. They:

- are willing to try new things
- embrace change
- are risk-tolerant
- have high expectations
- are interested in possibilities and potential
- give lots of honest feedback.

Given these things, how might we bend a little towards making and keeping them happy?

## To Do

- **Highlight the advantages of adopting the DS**: the current pain points it solves
- **Be clear and honest about the potential disadvantages or difficulties of adopting the DS**, and what we're doing to mitigate them
- **Let people know we want for for feedback, and act on it when we get it**
    - Review existing the feedback from new and existing users of the DS provided. Review how we've acted on it
    - Review the mechanisms available for providing feedback
    - Ask for more feedback from new and existing users
