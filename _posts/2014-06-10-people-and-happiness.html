<p>One of the biggest changes moving from being a freelancer to <a href="https://naga.co.za/2012/11/11/gainful-employment/">starting work at Unboxed in November of last year</a> was working in an agile software development environment. The part of the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile Manifesto</a> that I felt most strongly there was <strong>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools</strong> (which people often shorten to people over process (and other people grumble about shortening)). I&#8217;ve kept that lesson with me since I left, and I&#8217;ve noticed that it&#8217;s a thread that I look for in everything I do. </p>
<p>In the past few months, I&#8217;ve been feeling a bit overwhelmed with all the various extracurricular and meetup things that I&#8217;m involved with, but it&#8217;s the people part that keeps pulling me back in. It was quite strange for me to realise that, actually, I like meeting people and chatting to them. Finding and developing these relationships is one of the things that makes me happy. </p>
<h3 id="happiness">Happiness</h3>
<p>I keep coming back to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/01/opinion/sunday/why-you-hate-work.html">Why You Hate Work</a> in the NY Times. There&#8217;s lots of good stuff in the article (despite the aggressive title), but I like really like the focus on people over process, and even over clients: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>A truly human-centered organization puts its people first — even above customers — because it recognizes that they are the key to creating long-term value. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Focusing on customers over people is a only short-term win: customers come and go, but your people stay. In his fantastic book, <a href="http://www.geraldmweinberg.com/Site/Consulting_Secrets.html">The Secrets of Consulting</a>, Gerald Weinberg says: &#8220;it&#8217;s always a people problem.&#8221; It&#8217;s people all the way down. </p>
<p>After quite a few speed bumps while I was freelancing, I came to realise that being happy at work was more important to me than anything else. I use this as a guiding principle for where I&#8217;m at and where I want to be. It sounds kind of obvious, but it&#8217;s a useful yardstick to measure against. It&#8217;s not simple though: people are complicated. There&#8217;s autonomy / self-organisation to think about, sustainable pace / putting in sustainable hours, meaningful and interesting work. </p>
<p>My partner, Jo, is researching happiness in retirement and what the factors are that affect it, and so we end up discussing these kind of things quite a bit. As you might be able to tell from this brain dump.</p>
