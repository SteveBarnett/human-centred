Here are some things I try to watch out for in meetings.

- 1Ô∏è‚É£ One conversation at a time. We want all the content of the meeting to be relevant to all the people in the meeting.
- üè† Pay extra attention to remote people. We want to involve them regularly.
- ‚òï Have breaks if the meeting is more than an hour. We ideally want (short!) breaks every half an hour.
- ‚è≤Ô∏è End on time. If we don't cover everything, we set a fresh meeting for later.
