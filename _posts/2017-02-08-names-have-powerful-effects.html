<p>I’ve been a long time proponent of building things for the web using Progressive Enhancement. I even gave <a href="https://naga.co.za/2014/10/13/the-good-the-bad-and-the-squishy/">a talk about it</a> at the UX SA conference a few years ago. These days I’m wondering if the name is a bit of a problem, in a similar way to how saying that you “do Agile” is. I’m wondering about talking more about the qualities and values, and less about the name.</p>
<h2 id="a-quick-agility-recap">A quick agility recap</h2>
<p>(Capital A) Agile? (Lowercase a) agile? Eh, agile? Or just agility? There’s been lots of talk about being post-agile, perhaps most famously in <a href="https://pragdave.me/blog/2014/03/04/time-to-kill-agile.html">Agile is Dead (Long Live Agility)</a> by Dave Thomas. There are a lot of people who don’t like agile because they’ve had bad experiences of it. It seems like this is often in the form of things like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaled_Agile_Framework">SAFe</a> (Scaled Agile Framework) which tend to focus on the process and tools over the individuals and interactions (which seems a bit wonky when you look back at <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">the manifesto</a>).</p>
<p>My feeling is that some of the people that are strongly anti-agile that I talk to, or that I read posts written by, have experienced the dogma of it. They’ve been given a rulebook and told they must follow it, because then they’ll Be Agile and That Is Good. They maybe haven’t had the chance to experience (what I consider to be) the real core of it: inspect and adapt (in short loops).</p>
<p>The problem is that a terrible experience has become mentally linked with a specific word: agile. Now when someone mentions it, you might roll your eyes and switch off.</p>
<h2 id="how-this-is-similar-to-pe">How this is similar to PE</h2>
<p>I think a similar thing has happened with the term Progressive Enhancement. Over the years, some of the principles and ideals have become a bit misunderstood. The most extreme versions of the ideas have become interpreted as rules. “Be careful how you use your JavaScript” becomes “Don’t use JavaScript, ever.”</p>
<p>The (actual) underlying principles of a PE approach are ones that I think most people will generally get behind. <a href="https://abookapart.com/products/responsible-responsive-design">Responsible Web Design</a>. <a href="https://shop.smashingmagazine.com/products/inclusive-design-patterns">Inclusive Web Design</a>. <a href="https://resilientwebdesign.com/">Resilient Web Design</a>. But when we use the term PE when talking about these things, the mental shorthand that many people have goes to a bad place: super-nerd killjoys talking about supporting IE5 on a Mac.</p>
<h2 id="no-name">No Name?</h2>
<p>I would like to start using the term <a href="https://naga.co.za/2017/01/27/inclusive-design-and-accessibility/">Inclusive Web Design</a> as a kind of drop-in replacement for Progressive Enhancement (even though they’re not quite the same thing). But I think the same naming problem could occur. So perhaps I should be talk about the qualities that I value. Things like making sites responsible, inclusive, and resilient so that they can handle the wide range of user devices, networks connections, and disabilities.</p>
