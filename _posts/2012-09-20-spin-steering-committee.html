<p>It seems to be a week of exciting announcements for me. As of last night I've become a member of the <a href="http://www.spin.org.za/">Cape Town SPIN</a> Steering Committee. SPIN stands for Software Process Improvement Network. SPIN aims to help improve software engineering practice through monthly presentations, networking, discussion, and more. Have a peek at the <a href="http://www.spin.org.za/about/">about page</a> more details.</p>
<p>I'm very excited about being on the committee, and I'm looking forward to helping to make SPIN even more useful. One area I hope to make a few changes is the web side of the organisation. Since web sites are my speciality, I want to give the existing site a bit of an overhaul and make it even more useful to members.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, suggestions, or comments about SPIN <a href="mailto:steve@naga.co.za?subject=SPIN">I'd love to hear them</a>. What really works, what really doesn't? What would you like to see more of, or less of?</p>
