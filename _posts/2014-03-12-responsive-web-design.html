<p>There&#8217;s lots of discussion around the intertubes at the moment around Responsive: what it is and how we define it. Over the past few days, more of the heavyweights of the web development and design industry have chimed in. Here's a quick round-up of who said what.</p>
<p>One viewpoint is that Responsive Web Design is really just <em>good web design</em> or <em>web design done right</em>. Back in July 2011, Andy Hume wrote about being <a href="http://blog.andyhume.net/responsive-by-default/">Responsive by default</a>, and how <strong>the principles and ideas are behind it are core to what we do as a web developers</strong>. A few months before that, <a href="http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/blog/about/i_dont_care_about_responsive_web_design/">Andy Clarke was saying similar things</a>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Web design is responsive design, Responsive Web Design is web design, done right. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="specificresponsivewebdesign">(Specific) Responsive Web Design</h3>
<p>In his post <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/2014/03/09/evolving-responsive-web-design/">&#8220;Evolving Responsive Web Design&#8221;</a>, <a href="http://bluebeanieday.tumblr.com/">Blue Beanie man</a> Jeffrey Zeldman talks about how, although the Responsive Web Design is good web design (and vice versa), Responsive as a thing in itself is important. He insightfully points out that <strong>the reason RWD has caught on is because of the specific definition that Ethan Marcotte set up</strong>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>If Ethan hadn’t included three simple executional requirements as part of his definition, the concept might have quickly fallen by the wayside. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://markboulton.co.uk/journal/rwd-dtdt">Mark Boulton</a> brings that around to the business side of things, reminding us that <strong>it matters what clients think</strong>, and they&#8217;re beginning to know about the term responsive, and ask for it: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>You see, responsive design is a useful term and one that will stick around for a while whilst we’re going through this change. How else do we describe it, otherwise? Web design? I don’t think so. No board member is going to get behind that; it’s not new enough. </p>

<h3 id="deviceagnosticresponsivewebdesign">(Device-agnostic) Responsive Web Design</h3>
<p>Trent Walton&#8217;s article, <a href="http://trentwalton.com/2014/03/10/device-agnostic/">Device Agnostic</a>, rounds the discussion off nicely, and is well worth a read. He talks about the number of variables and unknowns that we have to take into account (screen resolution, input method, browser capability, connection speed): </p>
<blockquote>
<p>With such a wide range of possibilities, the sensible thing to do is to zero in on the harshest conditions (or toughest things to deliver) and build from there. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>He talks about Hostile Browsers: how <strong>a user&#8217;s choice of browser can sometimes be acting against design and modern web technologies</strong>. He also talks about flux. See Frank Chimero&#8217;s beautiful essay <a href="http://frankchimero.com/talks/what-screens-want/transcript/">What Screens Want</a> for more about that. </p>
<p>Trent also offers a timely reminder that it&#8217;s not all about the new and shiny: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>As web designers, it is our role to consider (and plan for) maximum reach and access, even when final results might seem underwhelming or less immersive.</p>
</blockquote>
