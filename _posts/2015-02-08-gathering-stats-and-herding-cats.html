<p>On <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Cape-Town-Scrum-User-Group-SUGSA/events/220204652/">Thursday 5th February, I gave a short talk</a> at the <a href="http://sugsa.org.za/">Cape Town Scrum Users Group</a> about <a href="http://railsbridgecapetown.org/">RailsBridge</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://speakerdeck.com/stevebarnett/gathering-stats-and-herding-cats"><img src="https://naga.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/gathering-stats-and-herding-cats-400x225.jpg" srcset="https://naga.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/gathering-stats-and-herding-cats-400x225.jpg 400w, https://naga.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/gathering-stats-and-herding-cats-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://naga.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/gathering-stats-and-herding-cats.jpg 2560w" alt="gathering-stats-and-herding-cats" width="400" height="225" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1170" /></a></p>
<p>My slides are <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/stevebarnett/gathering-stats-and-herding-cats">up on Speakerdeck</a>. I talked about <a href="http://railsbridge.org/">RailsBridge</a> itself (the upstream organisation and how our Cape Town chapter came to be) and the Cape Town team's focus on Continuous Improvement. I talked about the various methods we've used to gather feedback (and how successful or not they were), what feedback received, and what we did with it (lots of things!).</p>
<p>I'll be giving a remixed version of this talk at the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/capetown.rb">Cape Town Ruby Brigade</a> in March, where I'll focus more on the Ruby and Rails bits, and the curriculum.</p>
<p>(Yes, me doing all this Ruby stuff is slightly odd, since where I work now (<a href="http://praekeltfoundation.org/">Praekelt Fuondation</a>) is a Python shop. <a href="https://github.com/praekelt/vumi">Vumi</a>, for example, is all Python. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ )</p>
