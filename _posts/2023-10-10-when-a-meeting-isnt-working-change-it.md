What we want is happy, healthy, high-performing teams. Our meetings and processes are meant to help us get there. When they're not, we can try and change them. 

When a meeting (like stand-ups or retros) isn't working, we can revisit the purpose of the meeting and make adjustments to improve it. (Aside: [I think retros are the most important agile activity](/2018/07/03/retros-are-the-most-important-agile-activity/).)

- **Try changing the meeting instead of doing it and rushing through it.** That usually just makes a bad meeting feel even worse because we're focusing on finishing the meeting rather than making the most of the meeting.
- **Try changing the meeting instead of dropping it.** Meetings are usually added for a reason. It's possible that reason has fallen away, but most agile meetings have a clear purpose, related to helping the team.
- **Try changing the meeting instead of doing nothing**, or complaining about it. Highlighting problems in processes is very useful when it's done constructively. We don't need to have a solution ready to offer feedback, but we do need to be open to exploring ideas.

## Stand-ups

One meeting that tends to have a bad reputation is daily stand-up. For me, stand-ups are important. When they're working well, they:

- **Help us share information about the work throughout the team.** This gives people more context on their work. In particular it helps identify blockers and helps us coordinate where help is wanted or needed.
- **Help us focus on the work for the day ahead**. It gives us a change to note progress towards our goals (ideally the sprint goal).
- **Help us feel like a team.** The stand-up is focused on the work, but humans working together towards a common goal makes part of the glue that holds the team together.

One great reason to have a stand-up every day is that it means it's at most one day before a team member has a chance to raise a blocker or ask for help.

Stand-ups aren't status meetings. That information can be seen from the board. **The stand-up is for covering what can't be seen from the board.**

## Be clear on what's not working

Before changing a meeting (or before dropping it), it helps to be very clear of what's not working.

- Meeting's too long? Agree that we want more bold facilitation to keep the team on topic and on time. A stand-up is for raising things to discuss, but the discussion happens outside the stand-up.
- Meeting's not useful? Bring the focus back to the purpose of the meeting. A stand-up is to help the team work better together, by sharing information and helping each other.
