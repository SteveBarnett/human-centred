There's lots we can do to make our presentations and events more inclusive and accessible. And most of them are pretty easy, or require us to do less rather than more.

<div class="boxout">
	<span aria-hidden="true">💁</span> Summary:
	<ul>
		<li>Have one thing per slide, in large clear text, written in plain language.</li>
		<li>Have text alternatives for non-text content like images and video.</li>
		<li>Avoid animations like slide transitions and GIFs.</li>
	</ul>
</div>

## The event

- Publish and draw attention to your Code of Conduct.
- Share slides before the talk, or with a link on the first slide, so that the audience can follow along.
- Put supporting content, such as speaker notes, into a supporting document (e.g. blog post).

##  The presentation

### <span aria-hidden="true">📝 Content</span>

- Keep each slide short and to the point. Have one thing per slide.
- Make sure each slide has a unique and meaningful title.
- Keep links in slides short.

### <span aria-hidden="true">🗣 Language</span>

- Use plain language. Try and avoid jargon, acronyms, unusual words, and abbreviations.
- Check the reading level.
- Use incusive language and don't make assumptions about your audience. Don't be sexist, racist, ableist, or offensive.

### <span aria-hidden="true">🔡 Text</span>

- Use large text.
- Choose a readable sans serif font. Use bold sparingly, don't use italics, and don't use ALL CAPS.
- Avoid putting content at the bottom of slides.

### <span aria-hidden="true">🎨 Colour</span>

- Ensure high colour contrast between the text and the background. Take extra care with text over images.
- Don't use only colour to convey information. Use icons and text too, or instead of colour.

### <span aria-hidden="true">🖼 Non-text content (images, video, audio)</span>

- Provide text alternatives for content images, including charts. The text alternative should convey the function and meaning of the image.
- Explain any visual information.
- Provide captions and audio descriptions for videos.

### <span aria-hidden="true">🔁 Animations</span>

- Don't use slide transitions.
- Avoid animations for slide content.
- Use animated GIFs sparingly, or not at all, and don't set them to loop.
