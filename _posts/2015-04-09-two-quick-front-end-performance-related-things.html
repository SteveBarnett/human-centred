<p>At work I'm doing some researching and setting up of things to help improve the front-end performance of our stuff. Here are two quick things that keep bubbling up.</p>
<h2>Prefer fewer, larger, files</h2>
<p>Avoid many, smaller, files.</p>
<p>This is because, broadly speaking, <a href="https://www.igvita.com/2012/07/19/latency-the-new-web-performance-bottleneck/">latency trumps bandwidth when it comes to performance concerns</a>. </p>
<h3>Prefer simple CSS selectors</h3>
<p>Rather have an extra class in your HTML.</p>
<p>This is because <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/rendering/reduce-the-scope-and-complexity-of-style-calculations?hl=en">browsers can figure out simpler selectors faster</a>.</p>
