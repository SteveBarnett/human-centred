<p>At the moment I think I&#8217;m doing quite well limiting my Work In Progress: just working one thing at a time. I&#8217;m not doing so well with Context Switching: I&#8217;m being moved between projects quite quickly, and I feel like my work is suffering as a result: works feels unfinished, or of a lower quality than I am happy with. Here are some articles that I&#8217;ve been reading on the topic.</p>
<h3 id="limitingworkinprogress">Limiting Work In Progress</h3>
<p>The excellent <a href="http://www.personalkanban.com/">Personal Kanban</a> site has a &#8220;Why Limit Your WIP&#8221; Series. In <a href="http://www.personalkanban.com/pk/primers/the-basics-of-limiting-wip-why-limit-wip-series-post-1/">PK Basics: Why Limit Your WIP Series</a>, they talk about What Happens When We Don’t Limit WIP:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our attention to detail suffers, we leave things unfinished, or compromise the quality of our finished product. All of these outcomes create <em>more</em> work or us in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An excellent way to demonstrate the power of limiting WIP is the Aeroplane game. Karen and Sam of Growing Agile have an excellent write-up of it here: <a href="http://growingagile.co.za/2015/02/aeroplane-game/">Aeroplane Game</a>.</p>
<h3 id="onslack">On Slack</h3>
<p>From <a href="http://www.personalkanban.com/pk/primers/slack-why-limit-wip-series-post-3/">Slack: Why Limit WIP Series, Post 3</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We need slack for our own optimization. In our work, we’d like to have a degree of slack to:<br/><br />
1. Make sure we are able to focus on the tasks at hand;<br/><br />
2. Make sure we have the capacity to deal with unforeseen events;<br/><br />
3. Make sure we can stop periodically to allow our brains to perform vital functions in memory, processing, and regeneration; and especially to<br/><br />
4. Make sure we don’t work ourselves into an early grave.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On Medium, <a href="https://medium.com/@mariepoulin/the-big-mistake-nearly-every-designer-makes-aff96b43172c">Marie Poulin talks about slack</a> from a designer&#8217;s perspective. She talks about adding margins to leave room for error, growth, planning, and reflection.</p>
<p>The always excellent Alexander Kjerulf writes about slack in his post <a href="http://positivesharing.com/2014/09/why-every-company-needs-to-give-employees-free-time-on-the-job/">Why every company needs to give employees Free Time on the job</a>, and includes some practical tips on how to get started.</p>
<h3 id="oncontextswitching">On Context Switching</h3>
<p>Back in 2001, Joel Spolsky talked about task switching in <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000022.html">Human Task Switches Considered Harmful</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The trick here is that when you manage programmers, specifically, task switches take a really, really, really long time. That&#8217;s because programming is the kind of task where you have to keep a lot of things in your head at once. The more things you remember at once, the more productive you are at programming.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More recently, in <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-multi-tasking-myth/">The Multi-Tasking Myth</a>, Jeff Atwood talked about distraction and multi-tasking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We typically overestimate how much we&#8217;ll actually get done, and multi-tasking exaggerates our own internal biases even more. Whenever possible, avoid interruptions and avoid working on more than one project at the same time.</p>
