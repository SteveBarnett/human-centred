Here's how I like to run audit prebriefs: the meeting before the audit.

- **Frame the audit appropriately.** For example: the audit is about checking the accessiblity status of the site.
- Ask the team to do **a walkthrough of the key user journeys.** Record it so we can refer back to it later.
- Ask them if they have **any major updates scheduled**.
    - If there's a major redesign or rebuild coming soon, it will probably make sense to audit after that.
    - For now, offer support and training for for the redesign or rebuild.
- Ask them **what accessibility testing they've done already.**
    - Manual, automated, usability, something else?
    - If they haven't done any, discuss where they might start.
- Ask them what their **capacity to make any fixes** from the audit is like.
- If anyone seems particularly keen, **offer to demonstrate some of the checks** we do in an audit.

After the prebrief, I follow my [Accessibility audit process](/2022/01/24/accessibility-audit-process/). After the audit, I do the debrief: [Delivering the results of an accessibility audit](/2022/04/09/delivering-the-results-of-an-accessibility-audit/).
