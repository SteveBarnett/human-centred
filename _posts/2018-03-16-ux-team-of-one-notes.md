I've been meaning to get around to reading [Leah Buley](http://leahbuley.com/)'s [The User Experience Team of One](http://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/the-user-experience-team-of-one/) for a while. The upcoming [UX book club meetup](https://www.meetup.com/UX-Book-Club-CPT/events/246898855/) gave me the nudge I needed to get stuck into it, and I'm really glad that I did.

Buley's book is very practical, and I found it immediately useful. She provides excellent templates for activities and exercises.

I found the sections on dealing with issues (people and organisational) very helpful. Buley offers **great advice on how to approach difficult situations and diffuse them**. She also pulls in growth mindset ideas about **turning obstacles, objections, and failures into opportunities for learning**. (You can read more about growth mindset in [Carol Dweck's excellent book "Mindset"](https://www.amazon.com/Mindset-Updated-Changing-Fulfil-Potential-ebook/dp/B005RZB65Q/), or in [Fixed vs. Growth: The Two Basic Mindsets That Shape Our Lives](https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/) on Brain Pickings.)

My favourite thing in the book was the idea of **using bathroom / hallway UX to promote awareness**. I am definitely stealing this for the next talk or workshop I do! I'm planning to use it as a sneaky way to "advertise" for it and get people thinking about the ideas.

### How I try to remember what I read

[![Hand-written index cards with my notew from The User Experience of One](/img/2018/03/thumbs/ux-team-of-one-notes.jpg)](/img/2018/03/ux-team-of-one-notes.jpg){: .pull-right}

I'm still trying to find a good process for books. I want to **read a book, figure out what I want to remember, and make a plan to some of the ideas into action**. I like what Farnam Street write about reading, particularly in [How to Remember What You Read](https://www.fs.blog/2017/10/how-to-remember-what-you-read/).

Here's my process as it stands. It feels a bit over the top, but it seems to be working for me.

1. Read the book on my Kindle, highlighting stuff as I go along.
2. Leave it a few days, then run through the Kindle notes and write them out in a notebook. Make connections, draw boxes and arrows to pull out the themes I found.
3. Leave it a few days, then make a stack of index cards of the big ideas that I want to remember. (At the moment I'm overshooting here. I want a small number of cards, but tend to go into double digits!)
