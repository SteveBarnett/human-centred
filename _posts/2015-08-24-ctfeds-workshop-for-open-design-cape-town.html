<p>This weekend just gone, two of the organisers of <a href="http://www.meetup.com/ctfeds/">the CTFEDs meetup group</a> (myself and Justin Slack of New Media Labs) ran <a href="http://www.meetup.com/ctfeds/events/223987693/">a Future Friendly-themed workshop</a> as part of the <a href="http://opendesignct.com/">Open Design festival</a>.</p>
<p>We wrote up <a href="http://ctfeds.org/open-design-2015-principles.html">the principles that we&#8217;d be following</a> and <a href="http://ctfeds.org/open-design-2015-checklist.html">a fairly extensive checklist</a> of TODOs for workshop attendees to have a look through. We had a couple of sticky note activities to do during the day (yes, I use sticky notes for everything!) and Justin and I gave a lightning talk each (I talked about <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/stevebarnett/jquery-vs-javascript">jQuery vs JavaScript</a> (which I will do a short write up of soon) and Justin talked about <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/justinslack/iconfont-or-svg">Iconfonts vs SVG</a>)..</p>

<p>One of my favourite things about the workshop was that we had a wide range of experience levels: from people writing their first lines of HTML and CSS to people tweaking performance metrics on their clients' sites. It was awesome!</p>
<h2 id="whatwentwell">What went well</h2>
<p>We gathered some feedback from the students about the workshop: the things that cropped up the most were that people enjoyed the lightning talks (yay!) and they were looking forward to the next one.</p>
<p>This was the first workshop event we&#8217;ve run: we usually just have presentations. I really enjoyed it, and I hope that we can run another one.</p>
<h2 id="whatdidntgosowell">What didn&#8217;t go so well</h2>
<p>The checklist could have been presented a bit better. We printed out the whole checklist on one piece of paper, and I think it was a bit overwhelming. The idea was to pick a few that piqued your interest and just look at those, but that wasn&#8217;t clear.</p>
<h2 id="whatwecouldchange">What we could change</h2>
<p>If we run this workshop, or one similar to it, again, I think we&#8217;ll print each section of the checklist out separately: have just a handful of items on each page. It might also be interesting to have a limited number of cards: you take a page, do one thing, then put the page back for someone else to pick up.</p>
<p>I really dig stickers. We use them at RailsBridge as tiny Achievement Unlocked celebratory things, and I think I&#8217;ll bring them along next time. If you finish one of the cards (a print out of one small piece of the giant checklist) you get a sticker.</p>
