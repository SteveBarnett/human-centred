<p>On August 29th, <a href="https://twitter.com/ricegirl2">Sarah Rice</a> (Head of Communications, <a href="http://mxit.com/">MXit</a>) gave a talk entitled "<a href="http://www.siliconcape.com/events/august-academy-media-training-for-startups">Media Training for Startups</a>" for the <a href="http://www.siliconcape.com/">Silicon Cape</a>. This was followed by a Q&amp;A with Sarah and <a href="https://twitter.com/michatagana">Michelle Atagana</a> of <a href="http://memeburn.com/">Memeburn</a>. Below are my notes from Michelle's session. Additional items from Sarah are marked SR. (<a href="https://naga.co.za/2012/08/31/media-training-for-startups/">My notes from Sarah's talk</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ventureburn.com/">Venture Burn</a> receives a lot of Press Releases and submissions to their <a href="http://bit.ly/startupquestions">Startup Questionnaire</a>.
<ul>
<li>if you submit the questionnaire, you must be ready <strong>now</strong>!</li>
<li>answer the questions correctly, clearly, and simply.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There are three core questions for startups:
<ul>
<li><strong>What's your business model?</strong></li>
<li><strong>What do you do, in one sentence?</strong> (SR: can be short. Four words is okay.).</li>
<li><strong>Who are your competition?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Saying there is none is kidding yourself.</li>
<li>SR: alternative way to frame the question is: who's taking my money if I'm not getting it?</li>
<li>If your business is similar to another, what is your unique spin?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Press Releases</h4>
<ul>
<li>The first paragraph of your Press Release must grab the reader.</li>
<li>Ditch the buzzwords.</li>
<li>How are you making money? It's all about making money! Keep it simple.</li>
<li>SR: understand that, as a startup, you're low status. No need to grovel, but be open, honest, and humble.</li>
<li>Sarah's point of "Don't be an asshole": very important! Always ask nicely.</li>
<li>Journalists are stressed, they have too much work to do.</li>
<li>Don't expect them to remember you: they meet a lot of people!</li>
<li>Give journalists time to read, think, and write about your story. Don't pressure them, and do not go behind their back to their boss.</li>
<li>SR: if you follow up, be nice. Ask for feedback.</li>
<li>SR: Have a small list of people to send a Press Release to.</li>
<li>When they receive a Press Release, they'll re-angle it for their audience, find back up info, and make it into a story.</li>
<li>Memeburn is a tech web site: they want tech news.</li>
<li>Keep the tech as simple as possible. Let the journalist "tech it up" for their audience as they see appropriate.</li>
<li>Keep it under 400 words.</li>
</ul>
