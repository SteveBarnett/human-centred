I really enjoy making and using personas. Here's a quick overview of how I make them and how I use them.

I like generating personas in workshops. I'm usually there as a facilitator: the team I'm working with is the expert in the product and the users, so they do all the work. :)

### What are personas?

Personas are imaginary people that represent the edges of your customers, the most difficult you please ones.

### Why are personas useful?

Personas are a **quick reminder of your users' goals and needs**. They can be used as a communication tool to have better discussions about the product. They also help us have empathy for our users.

They can be used for **making decisions, defending decisions, and puzzling out feature requests**. Personas can help with getting priorities right: deciding on "nice to have" versus "must have" features, and on which bugs to fix first.

### My persona process

The overall process is

> Research → Sketch → Revise → Share

We do a first version of our personas (Research, Sketch), then we take a break. We come back to them with fresh eyes, make some changes (Revise), then get them in front of more people (Share).

The data for the **Research** phase can come things like existing team knowledge, statistics (from Analytics, support tickets, and so on), and any existing product statements or canvases (like Business Model or Value Proposition).

The **Sketch** phase has us scribbling down a name, a picture, and a job title. We're starting to pull together a picture of the person in our minds. We add a quote (a concise summary of the most important thing. Usually "I want" or "I need"), and a handful of bullets fleshing what they're doing and thinking.

When we come back to revise them after a break, we expand on the bullets, update the quote and picture.

The **Share** phase is about getting people outside the workshop to see the personas. Most often this means printing out colourful A3 versions, but also having a web version (I have [a slightly scrappy HTML and CSS template that I use](https://github.com/SteveBarnett/Personas-Template) for that, but a Google Doc is just as good).

### An example

Here's an example I use showing what I think are the essential elements: Name, Job, Role, Picture, Quote, and some details. If you search for "UX personas" you'll often find something with a lot more detail. Those look really great, but I find them hard to use, especially as a decision-making tool. It feels a bit like information overload.
