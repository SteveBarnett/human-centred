<p>I really like the <a href="http://pomodorotechnique.com/">Pomodoro technique</a>. I find that putting stuff into <strong>small blocks with clear boundaries</strong>, with <strong>regular short breaks</strong>, helps me be more productive. Lately, though, I&rsquo;ve moved away from using a timer.</p>
<p>I have a bit of an obsession with <strong>right-sizing tasks</strong>. I start by sizing tasks as either 1 hour, half a day, or a whole day. Tiny tasks get bundled into 1 hour chunks. Then I break down the half a day and day tasks into 1 hour mini-tasks. I prioritise the tasks and mini-tasks, then use a <strong>Kanban board</strong> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board">Wikipedia page</a>, <a href="http://leankit.com/learn/kanban/kanban-board/">article on LeanKit</a> to work through them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve found that <strong>with coding I prefer longer stretches of time</strong>. 25 minutes felt too short: like I was just getting into the flow of a problem when I had to take a break. So, when I use Pomodoros for coding, I tend to double up and use 50 minute slots, with 10 minute breaks.</p>
<p>These two things together (tasks about 1 hour sized, plus my personal preference for 1 hour pomodoros) mean that <strong>I don&rsquo;t feel the need for a pomodoro timer</strong>. I pick up a task, work on it until it&rsquo;s done, then take a short break of 5 or 10 minutes. Also: I kept forgetting to start the timer!</p>
<p>Do you use the pomodoro technique? Do you use a Kanban board? What do you think of this crazy pomodors-without-a-timer idea? I&rsquo;d love to hear from you.</p>
