<h3><b>Dave Snowden</b></h3>
<ul>
<li>Agile has an overemphasis on re-applying things that worked before. There’s a lack of contextual awareness. Deal with things how they are. Don’t let agile become a religion.</li>
<li>Be a chef, not a recipe user.</li>
<li>Use language that managers will understand. Changing language changes thinking.</li>
<li>People attach to negative pattern matches more than positive ones.</li>
<li>Interventions in a complex domain should be coherent, safe to fail, small, fast, and quick.</li>
<li>Trying to solve a different problem often finds a solution to your original problem.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin">Cynefin framework</a></li>
<li>The primary method of knowledge sharing is storytelling. People remember stories, not rules.</li>
<li>You need to understand what your users want, not what they say they want.</li>
<li>“When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.” - Goodhart’s Law</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Cara Turner - Building Creative Teams</b></h3>
<ul>
<li>Creative teams interact with work in a different way. Culturally, though, creativity is not trusted. Creativity arises from the tension between things. Creativity requires tinkering, which we are hard-wired for.</li>
<li>Tinkering and play is fun. People are much more likely to solve problems when they’re in a positive mood. Combinatorial creativity: new combinations of people or things. Ideas stick by using them. Create rich associations and force new connections in the brain.</li>
<li><em>Choose</em> to have a flexible mindset.</li>
<li>Our brains reward success, so set up a safe-to-fail environment. Frequent small successes are better because the fallout from small failures is not so bad.</li>
<li>You can’t motivate people, you can only remove the demotivating factors. Autonomy is very important.</li>
<li>Retrospectives
<ul>
<li><strong>Regular</strong>: keep looking where you’re going; easier to experiment; lots of feedback.</li>
<li><strong>Attainable</strong> goals: small goals; can add value quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Reviewed:</strong> increases value of responsibility; time boxed - constraint helps focus.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Try solving the anti-problem. Often generates insights about the original problem.</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Happiness at work - Alexander Kjerulf</b></h3>
<ul>
<li>Denmark is the happiest country in the world. Scandanavian culture is very work happy: <a href="http://whattheheckisarbejdsglaede.com/">arbejdsglæde</a>.</li>
<li>The balance of positive to negative experiences at work should be more than 3:1, but not more than 10:1.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Results</strong>
<ul>
<li>Pride, helpful, meaningful. Feel skilled. Receive praise and recognition.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Relationships</strong>
<ul>
<li>Have coffee breaks and lunch breaks for chit chat.</li>
<li>Speak to each other. Make a point of making eye contact and saying good morning every day.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Things you can do to increase happiness at work
<ul>
<li>Move around throughout the day</li>
<li>Do random acts of kindness</li>
<li>Remember three good things a day</li>
<li>Celebrate your victories</li>
