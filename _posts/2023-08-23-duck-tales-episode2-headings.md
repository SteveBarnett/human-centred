### Share your answers

Here are some example answers. Don't peek until you've shared your own, though!

<details>
	<summary>How many level 1 headings should a page have?</summary>
	<p>Just one! More is okay, but could be confusing. The heading level 1 is the main heading of the page, and should describe the topic or purpose of the page.</p>
</details>

<details>
	<summary>Who uses page headings, and how? Think about different humans and different technology!</summary>
<div markdown="1">
- screen reader users to hear what’s on the page, and to jump to a section of the page;
- sighted users who are visually scanning a page;
- search engines to figure out what’s on the page.
</div>
</details>

<details>
	<summary>What's the best cominbation of HTML and CSS to use for headings?</summary>
	<p>Semantic HTML, and any CSS that doesn't mess with the <code>display</code>! Unstyled heading elements give us a good guide: the heading level one should be bigger than heading level two, and so on.</p>
</details>

<details>
	<summary>What are some ways to check the headings levels on a page?</summary>
<div markdown="1">
- The headings [Accessibility Bookmarklet](https://accessibility-bookmarklets.org/install.html).
- [Ad hoc tools > Headings](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lGoEk0q_EBpzS3G7U93vbV-lYlvWGNmD/view?usp=sharing) of [Microsoft’s Accessibility Insights browser extension](https://accessibilityinsights.io/downloads/) (Chrome only).
</div>
</details>

<details>
	<summary>What makes for good heading text?</summary>
	<p>It describes the topic or purpose of the content immediately after it.</p>
</details>

## Check that the headings are marked up correctly

After five minutes of testing, stop and do a one-minute review with a partner. What did you do, what did you learn?
{:.boxout }

- Is everything that looks like a heading marked up as a heading?
- Are the headings ordered and nested correctly?

### How to view heading levels

- Install [Microsoft’s Accessibility Insights browser extension](https://accessibilityinsights.io/downloads/).
- Activate the Ad hoc tols > Headings.
- You can also check with a screen reader by listing all the headings or by using the “next heading” shortcut. (Have a look at [the 1st August 2023 QE CoP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixdmX9LGGSU) for tips on how to do that)

## Cool-down

### What next?

Set yourself a goal to put what you learned into practice.

- **What** will you do?
- **When** will you do it?
- **Where** will you do it?
- **Who** will be involved?
- **How** will you do it?
- **Why** do _this_?

Write a sentence starting with "I will...". Include as many of the 5Ws and 1H as you can for best results!

### Quick reflection

Pick one to answer and share with the group.

- What did you enjoy about the session?
- What surprised you?
- How confident do you feel checking headings now?
