### Effort is what brings success

- deliberate practice
	- leads to high-quality work
	- flow. happiness from a stretch on a difficuly and worthwhile thing
	- is how you become an expert
	- enjoyment / passion comes from mastery
		- don't wait for the mood. do the thing to bring about the mood
	- spaced retrieval
- need to be trained, practice deep work

### Be specific, make plans

- routines and rituals > hoping and thinking
	- well thought-out routine doesn't use up willpower, resilience, intrinsic motivation
- focus on tangible, substantial, returns
- focus on new behaviours, not the thing
- have public, accountable, progress reports
