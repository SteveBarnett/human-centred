A good few weeks ago [GAConf](https://www.gaconf.com/gaconf-europe-2023/) (Advancing accessibility for gamers with disabilities) was on. I've finally got around to watching some of the videos of the talks. Here are my sketchnotes from some of the talks.

## My top takeaways

Some things that come up a few times:

- It's much easier and cheaper to **think about accessibility from the start**.
- Developer and **debug tools can become accessibility options**. Customisation options are good for everyone.
- **Do plenty of User Research and Testing** with a diverse group of individuals.

- Review everything asking: 
	- What kind of barrier could be presented?
	- And how can we minimise that?
- Accessibility is not an add-on. It **opens it up** to more people.
- Test with a diverse group of individuals.
- It's cheaper to make changes earlier.
- Acknowledge mistakes (and learn from them) and celebrate wins.
	- Feedback can be difficult to receive.
	- But better to receive it earlier than later!
- Work on what will have the most impact.
- Share your stories.

- Our bodies change over time.
- **Ability** is the long list of things I can do.
- **Capability** is the shorter list of things I can do today.
- **Capacity** is how many things I have the energy to do.
- Our assumptions can create barriers: Prevent, Limit, Block.
- Empower people via options and alternatives.

- Do User Research to uncover issues, **test**.
- Do the most important ones first, and let people know.
- Allow customisation: it's good for everyone!
- It's much less work to consider it from the start.
- Debug features can become accessibility features with a little polish.

<div markdown="1">
- Don't get overwhelmed.
- Prepare your kitchen
	- Know what you need
	- Use what you have
	- Your team can help
	- Don't burnout
- Start and end with users.
	- Their wants and needs rather than features (which are just one solution)
- Reduce blockers, increase agency.
- Debug / dev tools can be repurposed into a11y tools.
- Existing conventions, techniques, and standards are easier to get sign-off on.
- More cost, less choice, as time goes on.
