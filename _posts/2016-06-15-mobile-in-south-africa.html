<p>Since Justin and I have started doing Front-end end Fridays (a weekly look at the performance of a particular web site: keep an eye on <a href="http://twitter.com/ctfeds">the CTFEDs Twitter account</a> for details), I&rsquo;ve been more concerned about how serious we Front-end developers are about the size and speed of our sites.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big believer in designing and developing <a href="http://www.lukew.com/resources/mobile_first.asp">Mobile First</a>. It especially makes sense in South Africa, where many users are <strong>Mobile Only</strong>. That means that every decision we make should be guided by the harsh constraints that implies. Here&rsquo;s a short round up of some stats that have been on my radar recently.</p>
<h2 id="access-to-phones-and-the-internet">Access to phones and the internet</h2>
<ul>
<li>85% of South Africans have access to a cellphone.</li>
<li>About 50% of South Africans have access to the Internet. 50% of those connect using <strong>only mobile devices</strong>. Most of the rest connect at work or at their place of study; less than 1% connect using only a landline.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="browsers-and-devices">Browsers and devices</h2>
<ul>
<li>About <strong>50% of South Africans use Opera Mini</strong> as their browser of choice. That means that your fancy, all client-side JavaScript, framework won&rsquo;t work for them. Android, UC Browser, Samsung browser, and BlackBerry account for about another 20%. That&rsquo;s <strong>70% of web access coming from some kind of mobile device</strong>.</li>
<li>The most popular phones are <strong>low-end, low-powered, smartphones</strong> like the <a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_lumia_520-5322.php">Nokia Lumia 520</a> and <a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/vodafone_smart_4-6447.php">Vodacom Smart 4</a>. Often these lower-end phones have a recent flavour of Android, but have CPUs of around 1.0 GHz, RAM of 512 MB, and 4 inch screens with a resolution of 480 x 800 (about 230 psi). By comparison, the <a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/apple_iphone_6s-7242.php">iPhone 6s</a> has a CPU of 1.84 GHz, 2GB of RAM, and a 4.7 inch screen with 750 x 1334 (about 330 ppi): a faster CPU, much more RAM, and a bigger, better, screen. <strong>These offer dramatically different experiences</strong>. In particular it has a <strong>strong effect on the parse and execution time of the JavaScript</strong> payload of a site. And that&rsquo;s before we even worry about how long it took to download in the first place!</li>
