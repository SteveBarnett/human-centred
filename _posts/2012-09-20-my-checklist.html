<p>I've just published a (rather lengthy) <a href="https://naga.co.za/checklist-and-tools/">list of checks that I do</a> for sites that I build. It's a bit unwieldy at the moment, but I'll to keep refining it.</p>
<p>The points are a sort of personal "best of" from sources like <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/">HTML5 Boilerplate</a> and <a href="http://underscores.me/">Underscores</a>. Previously I had the list in <a href="http://evernote.com/">Evernote</a>, but with <a href="http://devicelab.co.za/">Nomad Device Lab</a> getting off the ground, it seems to make sense to share the list as a reference document of sorts.</p>
