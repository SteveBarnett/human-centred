I recently(ish) read and got a lot from [Against Technoableism: Rethinking Who Needs Improvement by Ashley Shew](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77265030-against-technoableism). Below are my brief notes.

A big theme of the book is that the (ableist) world often considers disability a problem to which (more, better) technology is the solution. The main way to counter this false idea is to **listen, carefully and closely, to the experiences of disabled people.**

## Ableism and normalcy

**The ableist thinking and framing comes from social and structural problems.**

- They cast disabled people as fundamentally flawed, broken, or inadequate.
- They create create categories and stereotypes for disabled people.
- Categories of disability are constructed relative to our expectations and ideas of normalcy.

**The idea that there's one normal or healthy or right way to be is a culturally constructed fiction.** 

- There's no one right ethnicity, or gender, or culture.
- **Disability is inherent in the human condition.**
- It's a normal and predictable part of the human experience.

There's pressure to conform to the norm, to the average, to become normalised.

- **Compliance with norms is usually for the comfort of non-disabled people.** It makes life harder for lack of acceptance.
- **Impairments — lower functional differences — can exist without them being a problem.**

## The Social Model of Disability

The historical origin of disability was “anything that kept people from working”. It's deeply embedded in our society that being fit and vigorous makes you a good person.

**The social model says disability is a social construct.**

- A mismatch between a person and the environment, which was designed for and by normative bodies and minds.
- It pushes back against the idea that disability is abnormal.

Note that the word is **dis**-abled, not **un**-abled. Disability describes a mere-difference, not a bad-difference.

## Technoableism

**Technoableism says that eliminating disability is the goal, a good goal, and that technology can and should do this.**

- It says this under the guise of empowerment. 
- It simplifies the complex and nuanced problems that disabled people can encounter.
- It assumes people have one disability, which is not often the case.
- Technology increasingly separates our bodies from the world.

The views from disabled people are often very different from the "professionals." Many people value their experiences and community as disabled people.
