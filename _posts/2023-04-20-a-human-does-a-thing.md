I’m often thinking about new angles. New ways of phrasing or framing why accessibility is important. Here’s one I’m liking at the moment.

> **A human** <br>**does a thing**.

That’s it! A big part of doing accessibility work is bringing it back to the person and the task. The human doing the thing.

Working on the web, we can maybe be a little more specific.

> **A human** <br>using technology <br>**does a thing**.

One example could be:

> **A human** <br>using Safari on a Mac with a trackpad <br>**does a thing**.

That’s a specific set of tech that a human might be using to do a thing. But as soon as we start poking at that, we can see that there’s a lot of possible variation. Here are some ideas that come to mind:

> **A human** <br>using Safari / Chrome / Firefox / Edge <br>on Mac / Windows / Linux / iOS / Android <br>with a mouse / trackpad / keyboard <br>on a desktop / laptop / tablet / phone <br>in light mode / dark mode <br>**does a thing**.

Wow! That’s a lot. And that’s not even touching on an accessibility-specific stuff. How about this?

> **A human** <br>with smaller / larger text size <br>using ZoomText <br>in high contrast mode <br>using voice control / voice assistant <br>using JAWS / NVDA / VoiceOver / TalkBack <br>**does a thing**.

But whatever browser or Operating System or input device or assistive technology someone is using, it comes back to the same thing. We’re designing and developing these things so that:

> **A human** <br>using technology <br>**can do a thing**.

When we don’t do a good job of making accessible things, we can create mismatched interactions that lead to barriers to access. We stop a human from doing a thing!
