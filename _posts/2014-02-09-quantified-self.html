<p>I like numbers. Maths was always one of my favourite subjects, and I went on to do Maths with Maths (and more Maths) at university. Part of the appeal is measurement, because it can lead to insights and optimisation. Things like <a href="http://feltron.com/">Nicholas Felton</a>&#8217;s amazing annual reports fascinate me. This led me towards <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/">Quantified Self</a>, and it sounded like something interesting, and like something I wanted to do.</p>
<p> For quite a long time I used <a href="http://daytum.com/">Daytum</a>. It&#8217;s pretty easy to enter data, and its output options are simple and appealing. The entering of the data was a little too time-intensive, though. To get the most value out of it, you need to track a lot of things, which means investing a lot of time.</p>
<p>So I dropped Daytum and used <a href="http://www.moves-app.com/">Moves</a> for a while, but found it a bit limited. I took the (monetary) plunge and acquired a <a href="http://www.fitbit.com/">FitBit</a> (<a href="http://www.fitbit.com/one">The One</a>, since it seemed the smallest and least dorky). In the end, it was much like Daytum, though. It track some things easily, but most of the data was fairly long-form manual entry, and it gets dull after a while. </p>
<h3 id="reporter">Reporter</h3>
<p>When Mr Felton released <a href="http://www.reporter-app.com/">Reporter</a> the other day, I decided to give the whole QS thing another go. The thing that interested me the most was Reporter&#8217;s approach to gathering data: short, randomly timed bursts, with simple answers. Logging every single thing that happens might give you some deep insights, but it&#8217;s a pain to do. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m also finding that I don&#8217;t mind being interrupted by it. I&#8217;ve turned off just about all notifications on my phone, except for personal, just for me, ones like Twitter Direct Messages. I found myself spending too long playing with my phone, and wanted to remove some of the temptations to pick it up. Reporter somehow goes under my radar for, though. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m intrigued to see if I stick with this, and what extra little questions I&#8217;ll add myself. I&#8217;m not quite sure what I want to track, but I suspect a pattern will emerge after using the app for a while: blank spots that I want to fill, or things I&#8217;m recording that I actually don&#8217;t care about.</p>
