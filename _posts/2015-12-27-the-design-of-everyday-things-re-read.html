<p>I&rsquo;ve been steadily working my way through a re-read of Don Norman&rsquo;s classic <a href="http://www.jnd.org/books/design-of-everyday-things-revised.html">The Design Of Everyday Things</a> (holiday are <em>great</em> for reading for me). A lot of it was familiar, but I was reminded of a few things that I thought I&rsquo;d share.</p>
<p><strong>Progressive Enhancement</strong> (PE) and <strong>User-Centered Design</strong> (UCD) are really tightly connected. They&rsquo;re both about focusing on <strong>the needs and capabilities of the user</strong>. They&rsquo;re both about being careful: <strong>planning for when things go wrong</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="something-went-wrong">Something went wrong</h2>
<p>The fifth chapter, &ldquo;Human error? No, bad design&rdquo; in particular had me nodding my head a lot. It&rsquo;s all about asking &ldquo;how do we handle when things go wrong?&rdquo; and thinking about that often when designing.</p>
<p><a href="https://naga.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/design-for-things-going-wrong.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-1409"><img src="https://naga.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/design-for-things-going-wrong-393x400.jpg" alt="design-for-things-going-wrong" width="393" height="400" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1409" /></a></p>
<p>This is very much the thought process that goes into building with PE. There a lot more ways that things can go wrong that there are ways that it can go right. If build based on the best case scenario, we could end up with a lot of unhappy users.</p>
<h1 id="human--not-machine">Human, not machine</h1>
<p>Norman&rsquo;s notes how some badly designed systems treat people like computers: they assume easy pick-up from interruptions, the ability to concentrate perfectly for long periods of time, or high levels of precision. The one that particularly rang my bell was <strong>interruptions</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://naga.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/design-for-interruptions.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-1408"><img src="https://naga.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/design-for-interruptions-400x400.jpg" alt="design-for-interruptions" width="400" height="400" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1408" /></a></p>
<p>In terms of PE and UCD this made me think of two things: <strong>multi-device usage</strong> and <strong>network connection</strong>.</p>
<p>We know that <strong>people use multiple devices throughout the day</strong>, often for stages of the same task. That means we need to make it easy to resume activities from another device.</p>
<p>We know that <strong>the network connection and speed that a person has access to will be varied</strong>, and often bad. This means we need to plan for spotty network connections, and provide offline access where can (and sync up data when a connection is available).</p>
<p>In the book, <a href="https://books.google.co.za/books?id=nVQPAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT157&amp;lpg=PT157&amp;dq=%22the+best+solution+to+the+problem+of+designing+for+everyone+is+flexibility%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eSq6M0OYXr&amp;sig=a3wthIOTiVa6N32tBLB-sqrXhOo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiC_Jf80fvJAhUKPxoKHfbzAZkQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20best%20solution%20to%20the%20problem%20of%20designing%20for%20everyone%20is%20flexibility%22&amp;f=false">Norman says that</a> &ldquo;the best solution to the problem of designing for everyone is flexibility&rdquo;, and this what PE (and Responsive Web Design) does for the web.</p>
