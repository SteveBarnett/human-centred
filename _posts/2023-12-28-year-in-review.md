This year I changed jobs, went to some great conferences, gave two talks, and wrote a bunch on this site. I've also continued to move away from hands-on coding and into more support and (more recently) agile coaching-ish things.

## New job

This year I continued my mission to go Full Hippy and (left Xero and) joined the [Ministry of Social Development](https://msd.govt.nz/) as a Digital Accessibility Specialist. The MSD mission is deeply aligned with how I want to be in the world, and the kind of work I want to keep doing. Working in government has been a real system shock after working in the commercial world for my whole career!

## Conferences

This year was great for conferences, including some in-person ones! I went to JAFAC, went to Code Camp Wellington, watched GA Conf, and went to NZ Tech Rally 2023.

I also gave two talks, both in April:

- **Dungeons and Dragons and Accessibility** at Code Camp Wellington;
- **The ups and downs of working in Accessibility (using tennis as a metaphor)** with my colleague Maria at the Auckland Digital Accessibility and Inclusive Design Meetup.

## Writing

I ended up writing [just over 30 posts on this site in 2023](/archive/2023/). My favourites were:

- [Accessibility Audit Guide: writing good words](/2023/01/13/accessibility-audit-guide-writing-good-words/). I like writing guidance docs.
- [A human does a thing](/2023/04/20/a-human-does-a-thing/). I've used this framing in several presentations to illustrate the "it's a spectrum" nature of accessiblity work.
- [What I got up to at Xero](/2023/08/15/what-i-got-up-to-at-xero/). It was good to look back and see what I'd accomplished.
- [How I do support](/2023/08/24/how-i-do-support/). I wrote this up for the excellent human taking over my job.

And I enjoyed writing about what's important to me around the work, not just in the work.

- [The values that drive my work](/2023/07/07/the-values-that-drive-my-work/). I try to align my actions with my values, and writing up the values and publishing them is one way I try and clarify them.
- [How I do my best work](/2023/11/13/how-i-do-my-best-work/) (Finishing, Impact, Type, with bonus Bright, Open, Active). A little about values, but also about work style and fulfilment.
- [Human-centered colleague Manifesto](/2023/12/13/human-centered-colleague-manifesto/). A tongue-in-cheek remix of the Agile Manifesto, looking at how to be a good human around other humans at work.
