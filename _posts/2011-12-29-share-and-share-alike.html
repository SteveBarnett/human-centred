<p>I try, with mixed success, to spend a day a week working on personal projects. This often means something web-based, since I spend a lot of time online.<br />
One project that I'm still kicking around is a sharing / loaning / tracking web app.<br />
I'd like to be able keep track of who has my stuff, and let my friends know what stuff I have they might want to borrow.<br />
For example: we have a drill in the shed. If a friend needs a drill for a few days for a once-off project, it makes sense for them to borrow ours rather than buy one for themselves.</p>
<p>I've seen <a href="http://neighborgoods.net/">NeighborGoods</a> pop up a few times recently, and I like the look of it.<br />
Since it's got a lot in common with My Project Without A Name, I had a poke around to see if I could use it instead of building something myself.<br />
Neighborgoods is great and I really jive on their simple, clear, message: "Save money and resources by sharing stuff with your friends".<br />
It doesn't quite align with what I'm looking for, though.</p>
<p>I've always been a fan of lean and mean. Work-wise I'm very much moving in the direction of <a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?933" title="Luke W's entry: Mobile First">Mobile First</a> <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/" title="The seminal article by Ethan Marcotte">Responsive Web Design</a>: everything should start lean and fast, and build up from there. (I'm sure I'll also be re-reading <a href="http://bagcheck.com/blog/8-bagchecking-in-the-command-line" title="Bagchecking in the Command Line">Bagchecking in the Command Line</a> once I get started on my project again.)<br />
Applied to my loaning app, this would mean that at first there should be very little going on apart from the loaning and returning of items.<br />
The target audience is groups of friends who already know and trust each other, so there's no need for lots of personal information: just a name may be enough.<br />
Items descriptions can be short too: price, condition, exact model number probably won't be needed.<br />
The focus is on the in and outs of of your stuff: showing what's in and tracking what's out.</p>
<p>One big item that I still need to work out is money.<br />
If I manage to find the time to put it together and get it up and running, how do I keep it going and keep improving it?<br />
Will Google ads, or sponsored ads, earn enough to keep it going? Perhaps, but I doubt it. Also, I really don't like ads.<br />
Do I charge a membership fee then? How much? <a href="http://blog.pinboard.in/2011/12/don_t_be_a_free_user/" title="Don't be a free user">Don't Be A Free User</a> on the <a href="http://blog.pinboard.in/" title="The Pinboard blog">Pinboard blog</a> reminded me that it's okay to charge money for providing a service. In fact, it's often necessary.<br />
I think that if I want to be able to offer a really good product, I have to fund it somehow.</p>
