description: Three small things to check the usability of your stuff for World Usability Day
---

Today is [World Usability Day](https://worldusabilityday.org/). Their tagline is "No one should have to suffer through products and services that get in their way. People should not be made to feel stupid by technology." I couldn't agree more!

[Here are three short activities](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HZV78jhqTumbqVf1AiWaS7T0uqVtDT-h2uSiXcIUh8U/edit?usp=sharing) you can do to **check the usability of your stuff**. Pick one and spend about ten minutes doing it. The three things are:

- checking it works with just a keyboard (no mouse, no trackpad);
- checking the colour contrast; 
- checking the complexity of the language. 

We can see how people might suffer or struggle to use a product for each of these checks, or be made to feel stupid. Here are some questions they might be asking themselves.

- If they can't use it with just a keyboard
	- Where am I on the page? Why can't I get this to work? Why can't I get to that button?
- If the colour contrast is low
	- Why can't I read this text? Why can't I see where the errors are?
- If the language is full of jargon
	- Why is this so hard to read? Why is it so difficult to understand this? What do all these big words mean?

### (Not so) secret agenda

Pssst! I'm not sure if you noticed, but those three things are all ((not so) secretly) accessibility checks. **Usability and accessibility have a lot in common**. Usability is about how easy and pleasant something is to use. If someone is struggling to use a product because of a disability that doesn't sound like it's "easy and pleasant to use." If someone is being made to feel stupid because of a disability, that doesn't sound like it's "easy and pleasant to use" either.

**Making a product more accessible makes it more usable**. Making accessiblity improvements always helps people. In the best case we take something from ​can’t use​ to ​can use for some people.​ In the worst case, we make something a​ little easier to use for everyone​.
