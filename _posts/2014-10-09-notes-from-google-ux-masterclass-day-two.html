<p>Yesterday I attended day two of the Google UX Masterclass. Here are my notes on things that stuck out for me.</p>
<h2 id="usabilitytesting">Usability Testing</h2>
<ul>
<li>Always over-recruit a little. 1 in 5 participants is often not quite right: they don&#8217;t match the persona you want to test.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RITE_Method">Rapid Iteration Testing</a> can be useful: tweaking the prototype a little after each test.</li>
<li>Different age groups can have very different expectations. (This seems obvious, but can be easy to forget about.)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="launchandbeyond">Launch and beyond</h2>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;Err towards the cupcake.&#8221; Go for a smaller, simpler, thing first. (Related to <a href="http://www.designandux.com/2014/10/04/stop-making-bland-things/">Adriaan&#8217;s excellent talk</a> from the recent <a href="http://www.uxsouthafrica.com/.">UX SA conference</a>.)</li>
<li>There was some crossover on topics between UX and Product Management, especially for <a href="http://www.svproduct.com/articles/tag/product+discovery">Product Discovery</a>.</li>
<li>User surveys can be useful. Provide a feedback link. Make it quick and easy for user to provide feedback, and say thank you when they do. (It&#8217;s worth bearing in mind what <a href="http://fronttoback.org/">Phil Barrett</a> from <a href="http://www.userexperience.co.za/">Flow</a> said in his keynote at the UX SA conference, though. You&#8217;ll probably only get feedback at the far ends of the spectrum: very engaged users who are either very happy or very angry.)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="todo">To Do</h2>
<p>From day one:</p>
<ul>
<li>Update our existing Personas (and Customer Journey Map). Print them out nice and big and stick them up on the wall.</li>
<li>Set up regular, small, usability tests. (Although this is in my To Do list already)</li>
</ul>
<p>From day two:</p>
<ul>
<li>Review the first touch experience and make notes on where it can be improved, especially the registration bit.</li>
<li>Start tracking stats on usage: see what bits of the app people are using, and what bits they&#8217;re not.</li>
<li>Review the text of the app, especially CTAs and section names.</li>
</ul>
