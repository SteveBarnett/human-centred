<p>I've been reading a lot this week (as usual). Below is a selection of the more interesting links I found during the week. Most of these appear on <a href="http://pinboard.in/u:maxbarners">my public Pinboard stream</a>, and get pushed to <a href="https://twitter.com/maxbarners">my twitter account</a> using the magnificent <a href=" https://ifttt.com/">If This Then That</a>.</p>
<p>Presentations: <a href="http://webtypography.net/talks/sxsw2013/">Web Typography You Should Do Now</a> by Richard Rutter; <a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/2461754/beyond-mobile.pdf">Beyond Mobile</a> by Josh Clark (direct link, PDF, 11.2MB); <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/maxdesign/css-oocss-and-smacss">CSS - OOCSS, SMACSS &amp; more...</a> by Russ Weakley of Max Design.</p>
<p>Some articles that were particularly pertinent to my personal situation this week were <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3475-11-criticism-ratio">bashing vs disagreement</a> by Jason Friend of 37signals, and <a href="https://litmus.com/blog/using-internal-email-fosters-employee-relationships">Using Internal Email to Foster Employee Relationships</a> on the Litmus blog.</p>
<p>Something that I'd like to dig into next week is <a href="http://balderdashy.github.com/sails/">Sails: an MVC framework for Node.js</a>, with lots of Rails-like bit.</p>
<p><a href="http://browserdiet.com/">How to lose weight (in the browser)</a> has been doing the rounds, and is a cute take on improving Front End performance, with lots of useful code snippets.</p>
<p>My slightly ridiculous social schedule and jumping on to committees approach to life saw me help organise and attend a talk by friend and colleague <a href="http://richarcher.co.uk/">Rich Archer</a> entitled <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/richarcher/creating-maintainable-css">Creating maintainable CSS</a>. The talk was part of the Cape Town Front End Developers group: you can read more about the talk and CTFEDs in <a href="http://www.unboxedconsulting.com/blog/rich-archers-talk-at-cape-town-front-end-developers">my post on the Unboxed blog</a>. There were a couple of interesting speaking / presentation links that came up during the week: <a href="http://seizetheroom.com/">Seize the Room</a>; <a href="http://ladiesintech.com/speak-and-be-seen/">Speak and be seen</a>.</p>
<p>Taking a step back from specific tech, I was very happy to see <a href="http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2013/03/12/were-not-appy-not-appy-at-all/">We’re not ‘appy. Not ‘appy at all.</a> on Goverment Digital Service. The gist of it is "Web first, native if necessary," and it something I'm a strong believer in.</p>
<p>Not so work related, but important: <a href="http://reallyopen.com/">Really Open</a>. Although it's not a perfect site (for example, there are only binary gender choices), is challenges people about discrimination based on identity and orientation.</p>
