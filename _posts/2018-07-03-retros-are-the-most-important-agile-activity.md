Retrospectives are the best thing you can do to improve. They're the best way to learn about the team, the processes, and more. I think they're the most important agile activity.

One of [the principles of the agile manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) is:

> "At **regular intervals**, the team **reflects** on how to become more effective, then tunes and **adjusts** its behaviour accordingly."

Reflect and adjust. Inspect and adapt. Retrospectives are an activity to help keep a team on the course of **continuous improvement**.

What does "regular intervals" mean? For me, the best time means at the end of every sprint / cycle of work. Other timescales can make sense too. At the end of a project. As we hit a milestone. At the end of a rough week. At the end of a really good week.

A retro should ideally happen at the end of a cycle. If that's not possible, as soon as possible after the cycle. If there's a gap between the retro and the cycle, it helps to spend a little more time jogging memories of what happened. I've found [the Timeline activity](https://retromat.org/en/?id=4) helps with that.

The focus on "the team" is important too. The team being "the project team": the group of people who worked together on the project. In most places I've worked this is not the same as "the company." A company-wide retro can help reflect on more general things. A team-based retro can help reflect on more pointy and precise things.

## The format

The "template" I use is:

- Set the stage;
- Gather data;
- Generate insights;
- Decide what to do;
- Close the retro.

I often use [the Retromat](https://retromat.org/en/) to find activities that fit well together.

Here's a classic format that I've used quite a few times.

- 	`:) :| :(`
	- Write one of the emoticons on a sticky.
- What went well? What would we have done differently (knowing what we know now)?
	- Write one thing per sticky. Write at least one sticky for each question.
	- Look for patterns in the stickies.
- What did I learn?
	- Based on the previous questions and the patterns that emerged.
	- Write it on a sticky.
- SMART goal
	- Write on a sticky and take with you.
- Star rating
	- Give the retro a star rating: 1 (the worst) to 5 (the best).

I also keep [a GitHub repository of retrospective agendas](https://github.com/SteveBarnett/Retrospective-Agendas).

## Summary

Retros can help a team keep improving. They can bring the team together and help us inspect and adapt.
