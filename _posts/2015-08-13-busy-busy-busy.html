<p>The past few months have been a little bit busy. Lots of exciting things have been happening, and work has been interesting, but that hasn&#8217;t left a lot of time for reading or writing.</p>
<h2 id="capetownfront-enddevlopers">Cape Town Front-end developers</h2>
<p>At the start of July the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/ctfeds/">CTFEDs meetup group</a> had a great talk from Deb Butler of <a href="http://www.startumproject.co.za/">the Startum Project</a>: <a href="http://www.meetup.com/ctfeds/events/223410409/">&#8220;I Know More Than You&#8221; - Said Every Client Ever</a>. It was a frank and open talk about the trials and tribulations of being a freelancer in the web development business, and I really enjoyed it.</p>
<p>We also finally got around to starting our website: <a href="http://ctfeds.org/">ctfeds.org</a>. Yes, it is more than a little ironic that people who make websites have taken ages to make a website for themselves :). Behind the scenes the site is hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, and is powered by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. You can view the source code for the site on <a href="https://github.com/CTFEDs/ctfeds.org">our GitHub repository</a>.</p>
<p>Our next event is a little different: we&#8217;re <a href="http://www.meetup.com/ctfeds/events/223987693/">running a workshop</a> as part of the <a href="http://opendesignct.com/">Open Design festival</a>. The festival&#8217;s theme is <strong>Design is for Tomorrow</strong>, so we&#8217;re inviting people to come and get help making their sites more Future Friendly. <a href="http://www.meetup.com/ctfeds/events/223987693/">Join us</a>!</p>
<h2 id="speaking">Speaking</h2>
<p>At the end of July I was scheduled to give <a href="http://www.meetup.com/UX-Masterclass-Cape-Town/events/223437364/">a talk about the hamburger icon</a>, but due to a scheduling snafu at the venue it had to be postponed. It seems like it might be the end of this month instead: I am ready to rant!</p>
<p>At the start of August, <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/stevebarnett/number-fedlyfe">I gave a short talk</a> at <a href="http://friendsofdesign.net/">Friends of Design</a> about #fedlyfe. I talked about how I got into Front-end development, what the jobs I&#8217;ve had have been like (in terms of team, roles, culture, &#8230;).</p>
<h2 id="teaching">Teaching</h2>
<p>Then, just last weekend, me and a handful of fine friends ran a <a href="https://railsbridgecapetown.org/">Railsbridge</a> at the <a href="http://www.uct.ac.za/">University Cape Town</a>, for the Women in Computer Science group. You can read <a href="https://railsbridgecapetown.org/2015/08/10/railsbridge-at-uct.html">more about the event on our site</a>.</p>
<h2 id="phew">Phew!</h2>
<p>Maybe I need a holiday! :)</p>
