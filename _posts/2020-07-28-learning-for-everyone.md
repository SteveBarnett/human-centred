Last week I gave a short webinar at work. It was my first time doing a webinar (rather than a presentation, with live audience feedback), and I found it a little odd! I always enjoy talking about accessibility, though.

The focus was on making accessible content, and how it all comes down to good words: clear, plain, and meaningful. [The recording is available on Totara's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4WxHX2w8Nw). Here are links to a few things that are in the webinar.

- [Hemingway app](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/), for checking readability. I find it useful for getting a quick overview of a bit of text: is it okay, or does it need a bit of work?
- [A Web for Everyone (Designing Accessible User Experiences), by Sarah Horton & Whitney Quesenbery](https://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/a-web-for-everyone/). This book is a great introduction to accessibility in a wider sense, and Inclusive Design. It changed how I think about disability, and introduced me to the social definition of accessibility: [ability + barrier = disability](https://naga.co.za/2017/01/27/inclusive-design-and-accessibility/).
- [How to Meet WCAG (Quick Reference)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?currentsidebar=%23col_overview&levels=aaa&technologies=smil%2Cpdf%2Cflash%2Csl), a filterable list of the WCAG Success Criteria. A bit more readable than the official specification! I use this almost every day for checking WCAG Success Criteria. I like to link to an SC when arguing the case for treating a particular accessibility bug as high priority.
- Two guides to writing great alternative text: [Alternative Text on WebAIM](https://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/); [an alt Decision Tree on the W3C's Web Accessibility Tutorials](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decision-tree/). Good alt text conveys the function and meaning of the image. It's not always easy to do a great job of alt text, so I like tools like this to help me.
- [Accessibility Bookmarklets](https://accessibility-bookmarklets.org/), a little tool that highlights accessibility features of a page such as headings and landmarks. This is great for a visual check of a page without having to manually inspect the DOM or fire up a screen reader.
