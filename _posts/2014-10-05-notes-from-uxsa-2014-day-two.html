<p>Day two at the conference was a little quieter, but the crowd was just as energised. Here are my notes from the second day of talks: a few things that caught my attention. For each session below, I&#8217;ve tried to find one <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria">SMART</a> To Do item.</p>
<h2 id="theelephantandthedassie">The Elephant and the Dassie</h2>
<p><strong>presented by <a href="http://about.me/kerry-anne">Kerry-Anne Gilowey</a></strong> (<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/kerryanne/the-elephant-and-the-dassie-a-tale-of-evolution-and-kinship">Slides</a>; Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/kerry_anne">kerry_anne</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s important to <strong>break down the silos</strong> between roles in our teams and organisations. The edges of our roles and responsibilities are already blurry. This includes <strong>the client, who should be a collaborator in the process</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Lenses &gt; Roles</strong>. Even on problems that aren&#8217;t specifically part of your role, your lens can bring new and different insights to it: shifts the prominence of things in your view. Don&#8217;t be afraid to <strong>use tools from other roles</strong>.</li>
<li>The focus of our work is changing from the organisational structure to <strong>the customers&#8217;s cross-channel journey</strong>.</li>
<li>Kerry-Anne promoted <strong>openness and sharing</strong>. She encouraged attending, sharing, and speaking at meet ups. It doesn&#8217;t have to be a huge thing: a six person get together over dinner can work really well.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="todo">To Do</h4>
<ul>
<li>Share more about the processes, thinking, and design at <a href="http://praekeltfoundation.org/">Praekelt</a> (where I started working on 1st October). All our code is already <a href="https://github.com/praekelt">Open Source and available on GitHub</a>. Yay!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="typographyandimprovinguserexperience">Typography and improving user experience</h2>
<p><strong>presented by <a href="http://www.justinslack.com/">Justin Slack</a></strong> (<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/JustinSlack/typography-and-user-experience-ux-craft-2014">Slides</a>; Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/urbanrenewal">urbanrenewal</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>We should care about typography because <strong>so much of the web is about reading</strong>.</li>
<li>Optimising typography optimises many things: <strong>readability, accessibility, usability, overall graphic balance</strong>.</li>
<li>Typography should be involved <strong>as early in the design process as possible</strong>: settle on a typeface as early as possible; test type in the browser as early as possible; <strong>organise your design with readability in mind.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="todo">To Do</h4>
<ul>
<li>Review the typography of sites I work on, with an eye for readability. Update the <a href="http://typecast.com/blog/a-more-modern-scale-for-web-typography">typographic scale</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="productmanagementcognitivebiasandyou">Product Management, Cognitive Bias and You</h2>
<p><strong>presented by Carlo Kruger</strong> (<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ironicbuddha/cognitive-bias-product-management-and-you-39868212">Slides</a>, Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/ironicbuddha">ironicbuddha</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Carlo talked about the human brain, and System 1 (fast, instinctive and emotional) and System 2 (slow, deliberative, logical) thinking from <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~kahneman/">Daniel Kahneman</a>&#8217;s book <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow">Thinking, Fast and Slow</a>.</li>
<li>He talked us through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IKEA_effect">The Ikea Effect</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational_escalation">Sunk Cost Fallacy</a> (also know as Irrational escalation), and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwagon_effect">Bandwagon Effect</a>, and (with very wry humour) talked us through <strong>how they had applied to a project</strong> at <a href="https://www.unboxedconsulting.com/">Unboxed</a>. The case study really helped to bring into focus how easy it is to fall victim to these biases.</li>
<li>UX practices that bring <strong>measuring and the scientific method</strong> in to our work can help overcome these. Usability testing can help combat the Ikea Effect. A/B testing gives you metric you can use to get around emotion-based arguments. Cheap prototyping can help avoid the Sunk Cost Fallacy. However, there are cognitive biases mess with these practices too (like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne_effect">the Hawthorne effect</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error">Fundamental Attribution Error</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias">Confirmation Bias</a>)!</li>
<li>Despite the fact they our brains have adapted to let us tell each other where the good fruit is, we can fight back by <strong>measuring things, evaluating things, and practising mindfulness</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="todo">To Do</h4>
<ul>
<li>Review some recent (and upcoming) decisions the team has made, looking out for evidence of cognitive bias, and discuss with the team.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="applyingdesignprinciplestosoftwaredevelopment">Applying design principles to software development</h2>
<p><strong>Presented by <a href="http://www.designandux.com/">Adriaan Fenwick</a></strong> (<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/adriaanf/stop-making-bland-things">Slides</a>, Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/adriaanfenwick">adriaanfenwick</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>Your <strong>users are the most important aspect of building a product</strong>. Personas let you figure out who your users are. We&#8217;re good at remembering abut users&#8217; needs, but we shouldn&#8217;t forget about their wants too.</li>
<li>Adriaan also talked about <strong>breaking down silos and working in cross-functional teams</strong>.</li>
<li>The User Review part of a process must contain real world users, not just someone from your team. Take the team along to usability tests: it helps <strong>create empathy for the users</strong>. Take some time to evangelise UX and educate the team around you.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="todo">To Do</h4>
<ul>
<li>Set up one usability testing session and get some of the engineers to come and watch. This seems like a good first step to the &#8220;Set up regular, small, usability tests&#8221; To Do from <a href="https://naga.co.za/2014/10/03/ux-south-africa-2014-day-one/">my notes from day one</a>.</li>
