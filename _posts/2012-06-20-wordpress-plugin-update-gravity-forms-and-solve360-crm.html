<p>Since the release of the Plugin a few months ago, I've made a number of small changes to make it more friendly. The most important is also the most recent: adding <a title="WP-Cron functions in the WordPress Codex" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Category:WP-Cron_Functions">WP-Cron</a> support.</p>
<p>A <a title="Cron at Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron_job">cron job</a> is a scheduled, repeating, task that runs on a server, usually used for automation of tasks. WordPress has the WP-Cron category of functions that offer similar functionality, but with one important difference: the jobs are triggered by visits to your WordPress site (or Dashboard).</p>
<p>In the case of this plugin this means that whenever someone visits your site, all contacts added by Gravity Forms between this visit and the last visit are sent to <a title="Solve360 CRM by Norada" href="http://norada.com/">Solve360</a>.</p>
<p>A full list of changes made to the plugin is available in the <a title="Changelog of the plugin at Wordpress.org" href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/gravity-to-solve360/changelog/">Changelog</a>.</p>
