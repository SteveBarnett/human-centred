There are many things to talk about when we talk about AI. But one in particular keeps coming to the front of my mind.

Using AI to produce something seems to support **a culture that says the end result is more important than the process**. Sometimes that’s true, of course. But for many (most?) things, I think it’s not. More importantly, it seems to be leading us away from a human-centred approach to things.

## Coding

When writing code, the process of figuring things out is what helps the human learn. We don’t learn by just seeing the end result. We don’t learn the material for an exam by just reading all the answers of old exam papers. 

I mean “don’t” here in a slightly complicated way. I mean don’t as in it’s not the best way. We don’t learn as much, as well. We don’t remember as much, we can’t recall as much. Broadly speaking, because reading the solution to a problem is passive and figuring it out is active.

## Creative work

I think it’s even more clear for creative work. As an artist, a writer, a creative, the process of doing the work is deeply important. The process of making something changes the work as it’s made, and it changes the one doing it. And making something can be fun!

As someone interacting with a work, it’s important to me. Who made this, why, when. Having some background enriches the experience of the work.

* I think “it doesn’t matter who made it” is easily refuted. Imagine you receive a book as a gift.  It matters, it feels very different, if it's from a stranger or from your best friend.
* I think “”it doesn’t matter how it was made” is similarly easily refuted. Imagine you receive a cake as a gift. It matters if it was bought from a shop or hand-made by a person.

This is not to say that one is "better" than the other. But there is a substantive difference to our experience.

## More consequences

Some other things tumble out of the assumption that the product is more important than the process. One is the assumption that “more is better”. A common argument is that, because AI lets us make stuff faster, we can make more stuff.  It doesn’t feel like a “not enough stuff” is a problem we have.

This feels especially true for creative work. Do we want higher quantity? Or higher quality? These aren’t mutually exclusive. But it does feel like current AI usage is tending more towards higher quantity as a design goal.

Another tumbler is speed. The implicit assumption that faster is better. 

## Be more careful

This doesn’t mean I think “don’t use AI.” It means I think maybe we should be more careful, **more human-centred** about this. Maybe **the process is as important as the product.**

## Disclaimer

I’m a techy person, in a techy job. But that doesn’t mean any new technology is automatically something I pick up and use.  I keep coming back to something I read in [Cal Newport’s Deep Work](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27985224-deep-work), about taking a critical stance to adopting new things. Take a craftsman’s approach to tool selection: pick up a new tool if the positive impacts on core factors to success and happiness outweigh the negative impacts. (He was talking about quitting social media, but I think it applies more widely)

Written in a bit of rush, after:

- seeing AI buttons pop up in more tools that I use daily, without a way to hide it
- reading the latest [Pilgrims in the Machine](https://pilgrimsinthemachine.substack.com/p/writing-aimish-drawing-a-new-line)
- reading [Seventy per cent on The Imperfectionist](https://ckarchive.com/b/wvu2hghk5m82zf9r552rqtn34kzxxc8).

Please excuse the not-fully-formed-thoughts and (undoubtedly many) errors and omissions. 🙃
