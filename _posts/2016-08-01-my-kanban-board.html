<p>One of the things I&rsquo;ve been inspect-and-adapting over the past few months is my Kanban board at work. Here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve done and why.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what my board looks like now, with blank stickies for sizing reference.</p>
<p><a href="https://naga.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/board-now.png"><img src="https://naga.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/board-now-400x295.png" alt="board-now" width="400" height="295" class="size-medium wp-image-1537" /></a></p>
<p>I found I was having a few problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>too much Work In Progress resulting in scattered concentration;</li>
<li>lots of things in Review / Waiting and them getting in the way on the board;</li>
<li>a long To Do list that had stickies on top of each other.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first thing I changed was to make my Doing column a box big enough for just one sticky. An easy way to limit the WIP to one (as long as I use my board properly!). Doing that also meant I could use the rest of the column for Waiting. I've never been happy with a Waiting column to the left or to the right of Doing. Both feel kind of not quite right.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t do anything with my Done column at the end of a sprint except clear it out, so that became just one sticky wide, leaving lots of space for the To Do block. Since it&rsquo;s a big bigger I can arrange stuff in swim lanes properly too.</p>
<p>I like fiddling with productivity tools. :)</p>
