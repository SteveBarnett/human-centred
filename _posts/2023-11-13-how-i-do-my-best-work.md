I've been thinking about how I do my best work. And how people, broadly speaking, do their best work.

I've worked at quite a few different companies, in different industries, in different countries. Some things seem to be steady indicators for people to be happy and to be doing their best work.

I'm a good fit for a job when I have a FIT: Finishing; Impact; Type.

## Finishing

> I feel like I’m finishing work.

- Limiting Work In Progress.
- Smoothly flowing working with quick reviews.
- Quick and lean processes in the team and the wider organisation.

## Impact

> I feel like I’m seeing the impact of my work.

- Working closely with clients and with people doing the work.
- Understanding how the work ties into strategic goals.
- Seeing action coming from advice.

## Type

This is more personal: the types of work I enjoy most.

> I feel like I’m playing to my strengths.

- Supporting
- Training
- Writing

And coming in hot at the end of the list: Presenting; Coding.

## Other preferences

Feedback from colleagues across a range of jobs has taught me that I'm good at: being empathetic; making it simple; being positive. I also tend to be high energy when I'm doing work I enjoy (and vice versa), like a BOA: Bright; Open; Active.

- Bright
	- Concise not comprehensive
	- Enthusiastic not apathetic
	- Fast not slow
	- Optimistic not pessimistic
	- Upbeat not downbeat
- Open
	- Collaborative not combative
	- Connecting not dividing
	- Constructive not destructive
	- Open not closed
	- Thinking on a spectrum not a binary
- Active
	- Change-harnessing not change-avoiding or -complaining
	- Efficient not wasteful
	- Seeing change as inherent not problematic
	- Solution-focused not problem-focused
	- Thoughtful and considered not rash and impulsive
