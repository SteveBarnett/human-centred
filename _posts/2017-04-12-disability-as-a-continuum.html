<p>I’ve been thinking more about <a href="https://naga.co.za/2017/01/27/inclusive-design-and-accessibility/">accessibility and inclusive design</a>. I’ve put together a little list of three types of disabilities, with three things that we designers and developers can do to make our sites better for them.</p>
<p>As a quick reminder, it might be helpful to (re)define disability. What we define as a disability has changed a bit. This definition from the excellent <a href="http://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/a-web-for-everyone/">A Web For Everyone</a> is really great:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Ability</strong> (functional capability) + <strong>Barrier</strong> (created by product) = <strong>Disability</strong> (conflict between Ability and Barrier)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="physical">Physical</h2>
<p>Someone’s functional capacity could be affected by:</p>
<ul>
<li>having a condition like arthritis, cerebral palsy, fibromyalgia, or lupus;</li>
<li>being elderly and having decreased and less precise motor control;</li>
<li>having an injury.</li>
</ul>
<p>To avoid putting up barriers, we can:</p>
<ul>
<li>having large clicks areas;</li>
<li>making sure everything is keyboard-compatible (have focusable elements like links and buttons);</li>
<li>providing skip-to-content links as the first thing in the page.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="visual">Visual</h2>
<p>Someone’s functional capacity could be affected by:</p>
<ul>
<li>being blind, having low vision or poor eyesight, or being color blind;</li>
<li>being elderly and having poorer vision;</li>
<li>using an old or low-quality screens with low contrast and dodgy colors or being outside on a sunny day trying to use the shiny screen of a phone.</li>
</ul>
<p>To avoid putting up barriers, we can:</p>
<ul>
<li>having structured content using semantic HTML, having form inputs with associated labels, and having descriptive links and headings;</li>
<li>having information that isn’t only in images, that doesn’t rely on colour, or doesn’t have low contrast.</li>
<li>having content that zooms well.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cognitive">Cognitive</h2>
<p>Someone’s functional capacity could be affected by:</p>
<ul>
<li>having autism, dyslexia, or a learning disability;</li>
<li>the content being not in the user’s first language;</li>
<li>being distracted or in a rush and not paying full attention.</li>
</ul>
<p>To avoid putting up barriers, we can:</p>
<ul>
<li>using direct language and have clear and consistent layout and navigation;</li>
<li>using images, audio, and video as additional methods of conveying information;</li>
<li>having descriptive link and button text.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-next-">What next?</h2>
<p>I’m going to pick one of the things from the “we can” lists and review something I’m working on, to see how I can avoid putting up barriers that would prevent someone from using the site.</p>
