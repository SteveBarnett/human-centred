<p>A few weeks ago, the Austin and Wayne show (aka Austin Fagan <a href="https://twitter.com/austin_fagan">@austin_fagan</a> and Wayne Pringlewood <a href="https://twitter.com/pringlewood">@pringlewood</a>) gave a talk called &#8220;Building a great product&#8221; for the July <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Cape-Town-Scrum-User-Group-SUGSA/">SUGSA</a> event. Here are my brief notes. </p>
<p>They talked about <a href="http://impactmapping.org/">Impact Mapping</a>: a planning technique that brings back the focus to <strong>delivering business goals, not just software</strong>. It&#8217;s strategic planning, and it makes you think about <strong>metrics and measurable success criteria</strong>. </p>
<p>Austin and Wayne talked about their experiences facilitating impact mapping sessions, and how convincing people to try different approaches can be difficult. They recommend keeping the number of people in a session low, and not having too many passengers (people who aren&#8217;t actively contributing to the session, or directly involved with the project). They also said that doing impact mapping early is a good idea, and that there&#8217;s a strong connection between Impact Mapping and story mapping. </p>
<p>An Impact Map looks like this: </p>
<blockquote><p>
Why? &gt; Who? &gt; How? &gt; What?
</p></blockquote>
<p>with a branch occurring at each question. </p>
<p>The <strong>Why?</strong> is the goal. It helps to keep it tied to a financial gain. Have one per impact map. </p>
<p>The <strong>Who?</strong> is the actors: this can be a project, an organisation, or people. </p>
<p>The <strong>How?</strong> is the most important bit, and the hardest. Make sure that you identify the behaviour that needs to change. </p>
<p>The <strong>What?</strong> is the the part that we usually, mistakenly, focus on. As a software development team, it can be easy to think that the way to achieve the goal will always be with more coding, but this isn&#8217;t always the case.</p>
<p>The talk was followed by a hands-on section where we split into groups of five and ran through a very quick, minimal, impact mapping session with a made-up example. This was a really great way to end the session, and was a great illustration of how powerful impact mapping can be, and how complex and brain-bending.</p>
