<p>I'm running around at the moment organising a <a href="http://workshops.railsbridge.org/">RailsBridge</a> event in Cape Town, following on from the workshops that ran around <a href="http://rubyfuza.org/">RubyFuza</a> earlier in the year. I'm very excited to announce that we've just pushed the (work in progress!) site live to <a href="http://railsbridgecapetown.org/">RailsBridgeCapeTown.org</a>. Our first workshop will take place in July. With luck, we'll be able to turn it into a regular event: a workshop every three months.</p>
<p>RailsBridge's tagline is "<strong>Free</strong> Ruby on Rails workshops <strong>for women and their friends</strong>." It runs over a Friday night and Saturday day, and provides an introduction to Ruby and Rails. There's more detail on <a href="http://railsbridgecapetown.org/">the RBCPT site</a>. RailsBridge caught my attention because it's about things that I'm interested in and care about: gender politics in the tech space, and learning and education. I'd like to say a big thank you to the <a href="http://railsbridgecapetown.org/#teachers">teachers</a> and <a href="http://railsbridgecapetown.org/#organisers">organisers</a> who are volunteering their time to help make this happen.</p>
<p>If you're interested in attending please sign up on <a href="http://eepurl.com/zgRA5">our mailing list</a> for announcements. If you're interested in helping out, I'd love to hear from you: you can <a href="mailto:steve@naga.co.za">get in touch with me via mail</a> or on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/maxbarners">@maxbarners</a>.</p>
