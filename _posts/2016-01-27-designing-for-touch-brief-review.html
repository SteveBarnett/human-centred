<p>Over the holidays I took the chance to catch up on some reading. One of the books I read was <a href="https://bigmedium.com/">Josh Clark</a>&rsquo;s <a href="http://abookapart.com/products/designing-for-touch">Designing For Touch</a> from <a href="http://abookapart.com/">A Book Apart</a>. Here are some quick thought and sketchnotes.</p>
<p>Clark talks about how <strong>thumbs do the driving</strong>, no matter how large the screen. This has big implications for how we design our interfaces. Tap targets need to be big and the user&rsquo;s control will be imprecise.</p>
<p><a href="https://naga.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/dft1.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-1431"><img src="https://naga.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/dft1-295x400.jpg" alt="dft1" width="295" height="400" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1431" /></a></p>
<p>That leads on to thinking about <strong>letting the user manipulate the content directly</strong>, using coarse gestures: big sweeping movements that fling things around. Clark also talks about matching actions with the real world: if something on the screen looks like something in the real world, it must act like it.</p>
<p><a href="https://naga.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/dft2.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-1432"><img src="https://naga.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/dft2-382x400.jpg" alt="dft2" width="382" height="400" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1432" /></a></p>
<p>Another focus of Clark&rsquo;s book is <strong>progressive disclosure</strong> and just-in-time, contextual, information. Have all the information ready for the user, but show teaser trailers at first, and let them dive deeper when they want to.</p>
<p>Clark recommends playing more video games for inspiration and ideas (I am inclined to agree :) ), especially for the learning / tutorial parts of them. Video games often make users <strong>do the required action to proceed</strong>, which leads to more effective learning.</p>
<p>In summary: <a href="http://abookapart.com/products/designing-for-touch">Designing For Touch</a> is well-sized, well written, and contains lots of useful tips and examples for helping get your head around making sure that your interface is touch-friendly.</p>
