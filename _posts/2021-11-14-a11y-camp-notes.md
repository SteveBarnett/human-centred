Last week was [A11y Camp](https://a11ycamp.org.au/schedule-2021/), which was excellent as usual. I watched a lot of talks and took notes for some of them. Here are my sketchnotes (with text alternative immediately after them) and my top three takeaways.

## My personal top three takeaways

- Become more aware of my biases (because they create barriers to access)
- Help people employ a healthy level of scepticism about assuming things are accessible (so that they test more thoroughly)
- Think more about learning pathways (to keep people engaged)

## My notes from a few of the talks

- "It's {big co}, it must be accessible!" is seldom true. They're teams of people (that can make mistakes), just like us.
  - submit bugs
  - **extend** instead of reinvent
- Employ a healthy level of **scepticism** (aka Trust No One)
  - Ask for evidence
- Assume nothing
