<p>It&rsquo;s been a busy couple of weeks. I&rsquo;m helping out with, or running, a whole bunch of workshops and things. It&rsquo;s tiring work, but rewarding and fun. Here are some details, in a reverse Kanban style.</p>
<p><a href="https://naga.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/calendar.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-1465"><img src="https://naga.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/calendar-400x287.jpg" alt="calendar" width="400" height="287" class="size-medium wp-image-1465" /></a></p>

<p>Last week on Monday, Justin Slack and I ran our <a href="http://www.uxsouthafrica.com/workshop/cape-town-2016">Future Friendly UX Design workshop for the UX South Africa crowd</a>: it&rsquo;s all about designing for the long term. We first ran it <a href="http://www.uxsouthafrica.com/conference/cape-town-2015">in November 2015 at the conference</a>, and used the experience and feedback there to improve upon the workshop. We keep our notes and materials for the workshop on the <a href="http://ctfeds.org/">CTFEDs</a> <a href="https://github.com/CTFEDs/">GitHub</a>; feel free to <a href="http://ctfeds.github.io/FutureFriendlyUXWorkshopApril2016/">have a peek at them</a>.</p>
<p>Then on Wednesday, I teamed up with UX Designer Jen Poole to run <a href="http://www.meetup.com/ctfeds/events/228803699/">&ldquo;Help! The UX Designer isn&rsquo;t coming in today!&rdquo;</a> for the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/ctfeds">CTFEDs meetup group</a>. We took the attendees on a whirlwind tour of a (fictional) terrible e-commerce site and guiding them through fixing it up. The <a href="http://ctfeds.github.io/Help-The-UX-Designer-isnt-coming-in-today-Workshop/">materials from that session are online</a> too.</p>
<p>All day Saturday I was <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/175213616196460/">at the University of Cape Town</a>, helping run a <a href="https://railsbridgecapetown.org/">RailsBridge</a> workshop. It was well attended, and we had a great mix of people. I did <a href="https://railsbridgecapetown.org/2016/04/10/railsbridge-at-uct.html">a short write-up of the event on the RailsBridge Cape Town site</a>.</p>
<h2 id="doing">Doing</h2>
<p>And, on and off, on the side, I&rsquo;ve been helping out with the local side of things for the upcoming <a href="http://www.alterconf.com/">AlterConf</a> that&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.alterconf.com/sessions/cape-town-south-africa">coming to Cape Town on August 27th</a>: a travelling conference series about diversity and inclusivity in tech and gaming. I&rsquo;ve been helping to pull together the selection committee for the talks, finding freelancers to sketch note and take photos, and pinging lots of people who I think could contribute something interesting and amazing to the conversation.</p>
<h2 id="to-do">To Do</h2>
<p>The rest of April is a little more quiet. I&rsquo;m giving a talk about Progressive Enhancement to the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Meteor-Cape-Town/events/229419968/">Meteor JS meetup group</a> on Wednesday the 20th, then running a &ldquo;regular&rdquo; <a href="http://www.meetup.com/RailsBridge-Cape-Town/events/230170472/">RailsBridge on the Saturday 23rd</a>.</p>
<p>Phew! I think I need a holiday. :)</p>
