Accessible AV is all about providing alternatives with equivalent information, in case a person can't perceive the current media.

- **Video with audio.** At Level A, must have Audio Description (of visual content not in the audio) **or** Transcript.
- **Speech or other audio.** At Level A, must have Captions.
- **Visual information.** At Level AA, must have Audio Description (of visual content not in the audio). At Level AAA, must have Transcript.

## Exercise

Pick one of videos below. Watch and take notes on what might need an audio description (or be in a transcript). It’s fine to miss lots at first! It’s a learning exercise.

- Want something meta? Take notes on [Web Accessibility Perspectives: Video Captions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWO5N3n1DXU) (47s), then watch [Web Accessibility Perspectives: Video Captions - Audio Described Version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qIordU8vT8) (1m18s).
- Want something with lots of visual action? Take notes on [Frozen - Trailer with Audio Description](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7j4_aP8dWA) (1m31s). Listen **with the sound off first**, then listen again with the sound on.
- Want something with lots of dialogue? Take notes on [Pulp Fiction Audio Description Sample](https://vimeo.com/319349157). (3m50s). Listen **with the sound off first**, then listen again with the sound on.

### Reflection: what did you think?  

- What was included?
- What wasn't included?
- How did the timing work?
