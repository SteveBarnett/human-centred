<p>On August 29th, <a href="https://twitter.com/ricegirl2">Sarah Rice</a> (Head of Communications, <a href="http://mxit.com/">MXit</a>) gave a talk entitled "<a href="http://www.siliconcape.com/events/august-academy-media-training-for-startups">Media Training for Startups</a>" for the <a href="http://www.siliconcape.com/">Silicon Cape</a>. This was followed by a Q&amp;A with Sarah and <a href="https://twitter.com/michatagana">Michelle Atagana</a> of <a href="http://memeburn.com/">Memeburn</a>. Both were full of useful, practical, advice. I find <a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/">LukeW's notes</a> from the talks he attends very useful, so I thought I would try writing notes for the talks that I attend. Below are my notes from Sarah's presentation. (<a href="https://naga.co.za/2012/08/31/media-training-for-startups-qa/">My notes from the Q&amp;A</a>)</p>
<p>Sarah Rice has 12 years experience in the PR industry. She was MD of Sentient Communications until 2011, then took <a href="http://22seven.co.za/">22seven</a> to market, then joined MXit as Head of Communications.</p>
<h4>Why Bother?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Companies, especially new businesses and startups, often ask: why bother?</li>
<li>The ultimate objective is to sell more stuff. If your goal isn't selling more stuff, spend your money elsewhere.</li>
<li>Being the "best kept secret" is a recipe for fail.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What is PR?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Much more than logo and catchy tagline. It's awareness, education, and recognition of what you do, and of your sales staff.</li>
<li>PR people act as <strong>interpreters</strong>.
<ul>
<li>Business people, especially management, speak from their bubble, and in their language. Staff, customers, and suppliers don't care about spreadsheets and sales targets!</li>
<li>Think about communicating retrenchments as an example: the tone and pitch is very important.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>PR people act as a <strong>bodyguard</strong>.
<ul>
<li>They sit outside the message and speak to the major drivers.</li>
<li>Good communication provides a buffer zone when things go wrong: gives you time. When a crisis / disaster strikes, it will show you how good your PR is.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>PR is like <strong>fertiliser for your business</strong>.
<ul>
<li>It's not Direct Marketing, Sales, or Telesales.</li>
<li>It's about a slow, sustained, burn.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question from the crowd: how do you measure the effectiveness of your PR?
<ul>
<li>By perception over time.</li>
<li>Audit via sales team, customers, clients.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>PR strategy must <strong>support the business goals</strong>.</li>
<li>PR is <strong>communications</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Where does the media fit in?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Think about what you send to where, which channel to use, what actions the users take.
<ul>
<li>Increase engagement on an existing channel, break into a new space, convince a corporation to sponsor you?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When does traditional media make sense?
<ul>
<li>When it's <strong>news</strong>.
<ul>
<li>there's a persistent idea that the media is indebted to help SMEs. Not true! They owe you nothing. They exist for their readers, to share relevant, interesting, and meaningful content.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When your agenda and theirs cross</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What do we have in South Africa?
<ul>
<li>Financial print, Weekly print, radio, online, TV (small market)</li>
<li>Our media is not deeply technical, so blogs and user-generated media is useful.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What's happening in the world of journalists?
<ul>
<li>They're understaffed. Newsrooms aren't like the ones on TV!</li>
<li>They're covering lots of stories over many different spheres.</li>
<li>The older generation have tended to go off into PR or consulting.</li>
<li>The young generation are there, sometimes with little experience, no resources, and high pressure. They're stressed!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>What is news?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Things that have these qualities.
<ul>
<li><strong>relevancy</strong>: which media are you pitching to?</li>
<li><strong>timeous</strong>: must be happening now.</li>
<li><strong>proximity</strong>: must be local, South African.</li>
<li><strong>emotion</strong>: e.g. feelings of tech industry about recent Apple vs Samsung trial</li>
<li><strong>prominence</strong>: link yourself to a big name?</li>
<li>conflict: not great for pro-active PR, try and avoid.</li>
<li><strong>solid information</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question from the crowd: do tech people read print media?
<ul>
<li>Banks, yes.</li>
<li>Finding where your competitors is a good guide of where you should be.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>What to do: You</h4>
<ul>
<li>have a clear: action objective, message, story (are you the opinion leader, the first, better?)</li>
<li>support your message with proof points, stats.</li>
<li>have one good story rather than several</li>
<li>you must be able to explain yourself and your company quickly, confidently, and easily.</li>
<li>Question from the crowd: if your company is chaining, how should you handle it? It's a pivot, but we need to keep the old business going and solvent, and have the new one.
<ul>
<li>Rebrand with a new name, as a spin off of the old one. Let's you keep the same name for the old one, and gives you a new name linked to the old one's reputation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can't have an angle without proof points.</li>
<li>Dogfooding is not a story!</li>
</ul>
<h4>What to do: Them</h4>
<ul>
<li>Read the publication
<ul>
<li>who are the journalists?</li>
<li>what do they like, what do they do? Will your story interest them?</li>
<li>journalists fear no-one reads them. Tell them that you've read their stuff: it's a complement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>What not to do</h4>
<ul>
<li>Don't be an asshole!
<ul>
<li>don't edit their stuff, don't try and do their job for them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don't bring a marketing spin</li>
<li>Don't give misleading info</li>
<li>Don't be too cagey, and be honest. If you can't discuss something say why.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Now what?</h4>
<ul>
<li>If you're not the social type, send someone who is!</li>
<li>Stories with some difficulty, troubles, are more interesting. It's okay to be a little vulnerable.</li>
<li>Think about the narrative. There are many ways to tell a story; tell it your way.</li>
<li>The best way to connect is by telephone.</li>
<li>prepare for the call</li>
<li>have a reason to meet and connect again. Most people will agree to meet for coffee.</li>
<li>focus on the relationship, and the coverage will follow</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Lots gets lost over email
<ul>
<li>We haven't invented the sarcasm font yet!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>PR is a long relationship, a business journey</li>
</ul>
<h4>Writing an article</h4>
<ul>
<li>Press release
<ul>
<li>write as a thought / opinion leader, not as a marketer.</li>
<li>the big question is "So what?" Answer it!</li>
<li>See <a href="http://www.jennigay.co.za/">jennigay.co.za</a> for good advice on Press Releases.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>PR Professionals</h4>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>If you call them in, shop around. Look for good chemistry with you, an understanding of the market, honesty.</li>
<li>Hiring a freelance writer can be a good option.
<ul>
<li>don't let them send out the press release, though. Do it yourself to build the relationship.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The hourly price can vary, but about 6 hours for a press release, about 10 hours for an OpEd is a good guideline.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h4>Closing remarks</h4>
<p>Have fun!<br />
When it goes well, it's exciting.</p>
