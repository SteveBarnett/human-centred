Professionally this has been a quite a quiet year, **but/and** things are good. Quiet was what I wanted.

## Speaking

I did [a handful of external talks](/community/#workshops-and-talks-2022):

- a screen reader one at A11y Camp;
- a design system one at A11y Bytes;
- an introduction one at Wellington Xero talks.

I also did quite a few internal talks, at various Community or Practice meetings and things.

## Writing

I've also [written a fair few articles this year](/archive/). I developed a bit of a pattern / process that I quite like. When an issue keeps cropping up in audits and/or chats I think about it, gather my thoughts, then write an article here. Then, I tweak it and publish it on our internal Confluence. I use these articles as references. When a question comes up, I give the short version of the answer and link to the long version (the article). For example: [A quick guide to text alternatives for images](/2022/04/25/a-quick-guide-to-text-alternatives-for-images/).

Something I've written just for myself this year is [MAP: More Accessible Products](/more-accessible-products/). I took some time to pull together my thoughts into a more coherent shape. These are the things I've learned over the years that have stayed with me, the approaches that have been more successful.

## Working

At work we continue to revise and refine our processes. My particular area of interest continues to be audits. I like finding easy fixes for people, and figuring out ways of [delivering the results in better ways](/2022/04/09/delivering-the-results-of-an-accessibility-audit/).

Another theme for me has been "why can't it be both?". But usually in an asymmetrical way. [Crab claw: we need both big and small solutions](/2022/09/21/crab-claw/) and [The carrot, not the stick](/2022/09/28/the-carrot-not-the-stick/) are two examples of this.

I think we need more small claw things because they help the teams doing the work right now. But we do need big claw things too.

I think we need more carrot because it's better at making change and making that change last. But we do need stick too.

## Reflecting

I did some reflecting and became a bit clearer on my values at work:

- be empathetic;
- make it simple;
- be positive.

If I had to whittle it down to one sentence, it would be: **keep bringing it back to the human side of it.**

I also thought about what kinds of tasks I like doing at work. In order:

1. support;
2. teaching / training / mentoring;
3. writing;
4. presenting;
5. coding.

At the moment, I feel like I'm achieving this priority quite well.
