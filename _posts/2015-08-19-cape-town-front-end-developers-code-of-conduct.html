<p>From <a href="http://www.meetup.com/ctfeds/events/223987693/">our next meetup</a> onwards, all of our <a href="http://ctfeds.org/">CTFEDs</a> events will have a footer added, telling people that (TL;DR) they must be cool to each other. We&#8217;ve <a href="https://github.com/CTFEDs/EventTemplate/commit/414bc5a4052fdf27917c74cfbd2a876d6c637c2f">added it to our template that we use for our events</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Attendees must read and follow our <a href="http://ctfeds.org/code-of-conduct.html">Code of Conduct</a>. Thanks! :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We&#8217;ve had a <a href="https://github.com/CTFEDs/CodeOfConduct/blob/gh-pages/code-of-conduct.md">Code Of Conduct</a> for a while, and <a href="http://www.meetup.com/ctfeds/members/?op=leaders">the organising team</a> has tried to mindful of it before that. Finally getting around to publishing <a href="http://ctfeds.org/">our site</a> (via <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>) and <a href="https://pinboard.in/u:maxbarners/t:codeofconduct/">the current buzz around the topic</a> gave us the push we need to be more open and obvious about it.</p>
<p>The tech industry (and the world general) can be a pretty messed up place. We are committed to making our meetups and workshops friendly, safe, and inclusive spaces. Like <a href="http://seesparkbox.com/foundry/inclusivity">Sparkbox&#8217;s recent, brave, post</a> we realise that we have a lot of work to do, and we are trying hard to make our events better for everyone. We&#8217;ll be (re)reading awesome resources like Ashe Dryden&#8217;s <a href="http://www.ashedryden.com/blog/codes-of-conduct-101-faq">Codes of Conduct 101 + FAQ</a>, and blog posts like <a href="http://republicofquality.com/lessons-from-a-code-of-conduct/">Lessons from a Code of Conduct</a> and <a href="http://incisive.nu/2014/talking-and-listening/">Talking &amp; Listening about Conduct</a> to find ways of doing so. We hope that you will hold us accountable, and help us get better. :)</p>
