<p>Last week I went to the excellent <a href="https://pixelup.co.za/">Pixel Up!</a> conference. I got in at the last minute as a volunteer, which mostly meant handing out badges and telling people where the toilets where :) (but I also drove <a href="https://twitter.com/letspixelup">the Twitter</a> on day 2). I didn’t manage to <a href="https://naga.co.za/sketchnotes/">sketchnote</a>, but I did scribble down some key things and themes I picked up.</p>
<h2 id="just-do-it">Just do it</h2>
<p>A theme that came up a few times was to <strong>just do it</strong>. A few of the speakers told us not to wait for permission but to go ahead and fix things. For some things, speakers recommended doing that by <a href="https://twitter.com/letspixelup/status/861851320965267456">being an undercover hero</a>.</p>
<p>For other things, they encouraged us to <a href="https://twitter.com/letspixelup/status/861860691589967872">be the hero and to speak up</a>. This led on to the idea of the work being a team sport: <a href="https://twitter.com/letspixelup/status/861924646026870784">everything is a shared responsibility</a>.</p>
<h2 id="inclusive-design">Inclusive Design</h2>
<p>I was really happy to see <strong>Inclusive Design</strong> being a shared topic across so many of the talks. It’s something I care deeply about (see <a href="https://naga.co.za/2017/04/21/inclusive-design-what-ifs/">Inclusive Design What Ifs</a>, <a href="https://naga.co.za/2017/04/12/disability-as-a-continuum/">Disability as a continuum</a> and <a href="https://naga.co.za/2017/01/27/inclusive-design-and-accessibility/">Inclusive Design and Accessibility</a> from earlier this year).</p>
<p>The speakers talked about how:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/letspixelup/status/861896017117151233">control is an illusion and how we should design for the real world and real people</a>;</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/letspixelup/status/861874455852797953">we embed biases in products</a>;</li>
<li>we should be more aware how and when people access our stuff.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can <a href="https://twitter.com/letspixelup/status/861933538622541824">build a better web</a>. To really change our products we need to <a href="https://twitter.com/letspixelup/status/861886388014338049">change ourselves and change the way we build things</a>. One way to do that is to embrace Inclusive Design: <a href="https://twitter.com/letspixelup/status/861857063042994176">it helps everyone</a>.</p>
<h2 id="and-again--:-">And again? :)</h2>
<p>I hope Pixel Up! comes back to Cape Town soon. And I am seriously considering heading back up to Jo’burg for <a href="http://sourceup.co.za/">Source Up!</a> in September. Flights and accommodation<br/><br />
do bump up the overall cost, though.</p>
