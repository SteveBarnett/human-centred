<p>We're continuing to plow through our UCD stuff for Vumi. This sprint we've moved on to prototypes, but I'm still catching up with writing up what we've been doing.</p>
<p>Over on the Vumi blog, I wrote a bit about User Flows / Customer Journey Maps: <a href="http://blog.vumi.org/post/121586461515/user-centered-design-and-user-flows">User-Centered Design and User Flows</a>.</p>
<p>Questions? Comments? I'd love to hear them here, on <a href="http://twitter.com/maxbarners">Twitter</a>, or via email.</p>
