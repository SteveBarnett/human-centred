<p>The current landscape of web-connected devices is amazing and incredible. As a developer, it's also quite a challenge. I want to <a href="https://naga.co.za/how-i-do-things/">provide the best experience that I can</a> to every visitor of sites that I work on. Given the range of ways of accessing the web, that's no easy feat.</p>
<p>A visitor might be accessing it on an old Nokia phone over a slow connection, or lying on the couch with a tablet using a 3G network, or at their desk with a large monitor and a very fast connection. This might even be the same person at different times during the day. And that's only a snapshot of what things are like today.</p>
<p>I'm trying to work towards a <a href="http://futurefriend.ly/">Future Friendly</a> web and help others to do the same. One of the actions that the <a href="http://twitter.com/search/%23ffly">ffly</a> folk promote is <a href="http://futurefriend.ly/come-aboard.html#spread-word">spreading the word</a>. I've put together a brief, slightly localised, remix of <a href="http://futurefriend.ly/">futurefriend.ly</a> at <a href="http://futurefriendly.co.za/">futurefriendly.co.za</a> to show my support.</p>
<p>Are you feeling Future Friendly?</p>
