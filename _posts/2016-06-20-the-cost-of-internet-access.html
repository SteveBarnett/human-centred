<p><a href="https://theconversation.com/internet-freedom-why-access-is-becoming-a-human-right-59125">Internet freedom: why access is becoming a human right</a> on The Conversation makes for sobering reading. I highly encourage you to take the time to read through it all and let it sink in.</p>
<p>When we build sites that use lots of images or lots of CSS and (especially) JS, <strong>we cost our users money</strong>. We know that many South Africans connect to the internet using their mobile device and often only using their mobile device. Mobile data is expensive. The Conversation&rsquo;s estimates a range of R85 and R105 for 500MB of data.</p>
<p>As of 1st June 2016, <a href="http://www.httparchive.org/interesting.php?a=All&amp;l=Jun%201%202016">the average size of web pages was 2.5MB</a>. That means about <strong>R0.5 for one visit to one page</strong>. If a site hasn&rsquo;t implemented a good caching strategy, that means <strong>another R0.5 for each visit to that page</strong> (or to other pages that share the same resources like CSS or JS). And even if a site has a good caching strategy, files don&rsquo;t stay in the cache forever: the browser bumps them out or files get updated to new version.</p>
<p>Here are a few data points:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Mail and Guardian home page is about 11.5MB on first view. That just over R2.</li>
<li>The Daily Maverick home page is about 2.7MB. That&rsquo;s about R0.5.</li>
<li>The IOL home page is around 1.8MB. That&rsquo;s about R0.4.</li>
</ul>
<p>These single digit Rand amounts might seem small, but think about how these small pieces can add up. <strong>How many sites do you visit a day? How many pages on those sites do you visit?</strong> The Conversation article points out that the average South African income is around R1,000 per month. For many South Africans, even those well above this line, <strong>the cost of visiting our sites is a material cost as a percent of their income</strong>. We have to do better, and make critical review of Front-end performance an important and necessary part of every project we work on.</p>
<h2 id="what-s-next-">What&rsquo;s next?</h2>
<p>I really like Tim Kadlec&rsquo;s <a href="http://whatdoesmysitecost.com/">What does my site cost?</a>. I&rsquo;d like to put together a simplified and more localised South African version.</p>
