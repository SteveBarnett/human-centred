<p>Last week I attended <a href="http://www.rubyfuza.org/">RubyFuza</a> (a conference about the Ruby programming language and related goodness). A couple of the speakers mentioned browser support for particular front-end features with a sigh and a shake of the head, and a chuckle from the audience. It&rsquo;s funny because it&rsquo;s a shared pain, but for me this attitude feels like it&rsquo;s based on an incorrect assumption: that a website (or web app or <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/6246">web thang</a>) <a href="http://dowebsitesneedtobeexperiencedexactlythesameineverybrowser.com/">has to be experienced the same in every browser</a>. I don&rsquo;t believe that they do.</p>
<p>The discussion would go something like:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Here is this rad thing. Here is the browser support for the rad thing. If you have to support older browsers, you&rsquo;re gonna have a bad time.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think that this is only true if we are expecting people to have identical experiences on different browsers.</p>

<p>If we accept that different browsers have different capabilities, that it&rsquo;s up to the user how they view and use our stuff, and <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/dao">let go of the illusion of control</a>, then we realise that it&rsquo;s okay if (for example) <a href="http://caniuse.com/#search=geolocation">some users have to manually select their province rather than have it looked up for them</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-mobile-">What about mobile?</h2>
<p>Support is also often talked about just in terms of desktop browsers, and mostly what version of Internet Explorer a given feature is available for. I think this is partly because that&rsquo;s where our biggest problems tend to be for desktop browsers (And even when Microsoft stop supporting an old version of IE, <a href="https://naga.co.za/2016/01/07/the-end-of-ie-support-doesnt-mean-the-end-of-ie-support/">it doesn&rsquo;t mean people stop using it</a>). To some degree, it depends who your audience are, but generally speaking <a href="http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2015/6/19/presentation-mobile-is-eating-the-world">mobile is eating the world</a> and your users are either already big mobile users, or will be soon.</p>
<p><a href="https://naga.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/mobile-vs-desktop.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-1437"><img src="https://naga.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/mobile-vs-desktop-400x139.jpg" alt="mobile-vs-desktop" width="400" height="139" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1437" /></a></p>
<p>The excellent <a href="http://caniuse.com">caniuse.com</a> does a pretty good job of highlighting this: <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-animation">search for a feature</a> and it shows the popular desktop browsers, then iOS Safari, Opera Mini, Android Browser, and Chrome for Android. Woot!</p>
<h2 id="yes--this-again">Yes, this again</h2>
<p>Different people will experience our sites differently whether we like it or not. We need to embrace this difference in our sites, apps, and things. (And, unsurprisingly, <a href="https://naga.co.za/2015/08/19/my-preferred-front-end-development-process/">I think Progressive Enhancement is the best way to handle this</a>. :) )</p>
