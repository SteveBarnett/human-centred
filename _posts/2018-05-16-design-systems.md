[Alla Kholmatova](http://www.craftui.com/)'s book, [Design Systems](http://designsystemsbook.com/), is **great**. I found it was a good mix of things I didn't know and things that I knew, but because Kholmatova explained them so clearly, I now **understand**.

Here I'm pulling together my notes and thoughts to apply what I learned to my next project. It's a little bit more bullet-y and checklist-y than article-y. I've added stars ★ to the bits that really jumped out at me, or had me nodding along as I was reading.

### Design Principles

[![](/img/2018/05/thumbs/design-systems-design-principles.jpg)](/img/2018/05/design-systems-design-principles.jpg)

- Start with the **purpose**: it informs decisions and shape patterns.
- ★ Have 3-5, in constant use.
- Make them actionable, opinionated, memorable
- Test and evolve them over time.

### Functional Patterns (think HTML)

[![](/img/2018/05/thumbs/design-systems-functional-patterns.jpg)](/img/2018/05/design-systems-functional-patterns.jpg)

- **Patterns** (view them as **actions**) evolve, **behaviours** remain.
- Link them to the **purpose**.
- ★ Link them to user behaviours, patterns that encourage those behaviours. Makes for more **robust** modules.

### Perceptual Patterns (think CSS, JS)

[![](/img/2018/05/thumbs/design-systems-perceptual-patterns.jpg)](/img/2018/05/design-systems-perceptual-patterns.jpg)

- Ethos, brand. Examples (each has their own system): voice and tone, typography, layout.
- ★ These **connect** the parts of the system.
- Note: there will always be custom bits and once-off tweaks.

### Shared Language

- Bridges the gap between the **system image** and the **user model**.
- ★ Know the **most effective patterns** and **what makes them work**.
- **Wording is fundamental**
    - Names shape an object's future.
    - Don't use presentational ones.
- ★ Good names: are based on metaphors; have personality; communicate the purpose; give guidance / inspiration on where to use.
- Name collaboratively.
- Refer to them by their name in day-to-day conversations.

### Planning and practicalities

[![](/img/2018/05/thumbs/design-systems-planning-and-practicalities.jpg)](/img/2018/05/design-systems-planning-and-practicalities.jpg)

- Show the **business case**
    - ★ Meet the business goals **faster, at a lower cost**
    - Reusable, so save time on design and dev
    - Save time on site-wide changes
    - Launch new things faster
- Also: visual consistency, better collaboration
- Share successes, ★ stumbling blocks, knowledge across teams and disciplines

★ The right approach is one where you can **manage the downsides**.

### Systematising Functional Patterns

[![](/img/2018/05/thumbs/design-systems-systematising-functional-patterns.jpg)](/img/2018/05/design-systems-systematising-functional-patterns.jpg)

Do the **Essential / Fundamental** patterns first.

1. Identify key behaviours.
    - Break down into actions.
2. Group by purpose.
3. Define patterns.
    - Specificity scale is tricky. Name helps.
    - Content structure, with variants.
4. Repeat 1, 2, 3, at small scale.

Have **consistent expression of purpose**.

### Systematising Perceptual Patterns

[![](/img/2018/05/thumbs/design-systems-systematising-perceptual-patterns.jpg)](/img/2018/05/design-systems-systematising-perceptual-patterns.jpg)

Do the aesthetic qualities and **signature** (memorable, district) patterns first.

1. Start with purpose. Be specific.
2. Collect and group existing.
3. Define patterns and building blocks.
4. Agree on principles.

Note

- ★ **Clear** guidelines.
- ★ Should **feel** like it acts.
- Shared **use**, **role** of colour (not just the RGB).

### Pattern Libraries

[![](/img/2018/05/thumbs/design-systems-pattern-libraries.jpg)](/img/2018/05/design-systems-pattern-libraries.jpg)

- ★ Multidisciplinary is more **resilient**, **enduring**.
- ★ Examples, with variants, enhance the understanding of the purpose.
- ★ **Findability** of modules is a big barrier to adoption. Keep it simple.
- ★ **Workflow**: have a **process** for adding, even if it's loose.
