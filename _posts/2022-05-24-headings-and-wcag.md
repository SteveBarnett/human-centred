Here are some heading-related situations you might find on a web page and whether they are WCAG fails or just a bit weird.

## An element looks like a heading, but isn‚Äôt marked up as a heading

For example `div class=‚Äúlooks-like-a-heading‚Äù` instead of `h2`.

<span aria-hidden="true">‚ùå </span>WCAG fail!

This comes under [1.3.1 Info and Relationships ‚Äì Level A](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?currentsidebar=%23col_overview&levels=aaa&technologies=smil%2Cpdf%2Cflash%2Csl#info-and-relationships): ‚ÄúInformation, structure, and relationships conveyed through presentation can be programmatically determined or are available in text.‚Äù

If it looks like a duck, it should quack like a duck. Hey, did you do a [QAC](http://127.0.0.1:4000/2021/12/13/qac/)? ü¶Ü

## There are multiple `h1`s (or no `h1`)

<span aria-hidden="true">‚úã </span>Not a WCAG fail!

It‚Äôs a bit weird though. Ideally every page should have one `h1` at the start of the main content. The text content of the `h1` should be similar to the page `title`.

## Skipped heading levels

For example: `h1` then `h3` then `h4`.

<span aria-hidden="true">‚úã </span>Not a WCAG fail!

It‚Äôs a bit weird though. Keeping a correct hierarchy lets people use the headings a bit like a table of contents.

## Out of order headings

For example: `h1` then `h3` then `h2`.

<span aria-hidden="true">‚ùå </span>WCAG fail!

This is 1.3.1 Info and Relationships ‚Äì Level A again.

The markup needs to match the meaning. The `h`-level should match its importance in the hierarchy of the page.
