<p>Just released today is a new WordPress Plugin: <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/ricg-responsive-images/">RICG Responsive Images</a>. I think this is the start of kind of a big deal.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Important I-got-it-wrong addendum</strong>: it works everywhere, automagically! <a href="https://twitter.com/maxbarners/status/558514212851695616">See Tim Evko's tweet</a>. That is seriously amazing and <strong>a big deal</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>I know that some people aren't very fond of WordPress. Static site generators are all the rage these days. WP is not as light as <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and it's not as cool as <a href="http://wintersmith.io/">Wintersmith</a> (or whatever tiny static generator is the new hotness). I still use WordPress for this site (although I do use Jekyll for a bunch of other stuff).</p>
<p>The thing is that WP has a very low barrier to entry, so lots and lots of people use it ("WordPress powers 23% of the internet" according to <a href="https://wordpress.com/">WordPress.com</a> today.). You don't have to know how to code to get a site up and running, and pick a Theme and play with the design. That's pretty awesome.</p>
<p>The plugin let's you hardcode <code>srcset</code>-powered responsive images in to a template. That means that, for now, only Template authors can really use it, and only for images in the template (not for content images). This is still a big deal though, and the start of something awesome: the roll out of responsive images to a lot more of the web. Huzzah!</p>
