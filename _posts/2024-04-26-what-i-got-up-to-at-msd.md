A few weeks ago, I finished up at the Ministry of Social Development (MSD). I took some time to look back and reflect on what I did there.

- **Reviewed visual and interaction designs.** Initial concepts, wireframes, and prototypes. Delivered feedback in co-working sessions, Figma, and documentation on Confluence.
- **Conducted accessibility audits and assessments.** Audited websites against WCAG and best practice using a mix of assistive technologies, including screen readers. Provided code-based solutions in chat and in repositories.
    - Advocated for Shifting Left, but met teams where they where.
    - Covered various types of websites: modern to legacy, forms to self-service kiosks.
- **Provided technical HTML, CSS, and JS support to internal developer teams and external vendors.** Advised on ARIA usage. Coached, but provided direct solutions when appropriate. Brought it back to the humans who are our clients and colleagues.
- **Drove continuous improvement in the team and its processes.** Updated audit documentation and templates. Improved team workflow, meetings, and feedback loops. Started and drove initiatives: measuring our success; creating a skills matrix.
- **Presented to the team and advocated accessibility to the wider organisation.** Covered a broad range of accessibility and agile topics. Worked with Team Leads to improve the monthly reports to Executives.

If this sounds a bit like bullet points from a CV... It is!
