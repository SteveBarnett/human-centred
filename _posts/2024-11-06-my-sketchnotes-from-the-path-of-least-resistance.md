Last night was the last Wellington Web Accessibility Meetup of the year, [The Path of Least Resistance Toward Accessibility](https://www.meetup.com/wellington-web-accessibility-meetup/events/303908021/), and it was great! Below are my (sketch)notes.

[Dianne Tennent](https://www.linkedin.com/in/diannetennent/) gave a great talk on "How can we embed Accessibility into the way we work?"

- Ideally, accessibility from the ground up.
- Be aware that enthusiasm can come in waves.
- Some resistances to doing accessibility work: Time; WCAG; Expertise; Priorities; Technical Risk.

A path to accessibility:

1. C-level Mandate.
2. Leverage automation.
    - map coverage, prioritise.
3. Don't reinvent the wheel.
4. Focus on the human quotient.
5. Talk about debt.
6. Aim low.
    - Low hanging fruit.
7. Within-team collaboration.
8. Cross-team knowledge distribution.
