<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Training-Back-Room-Aside-Learn-ebook/dp/B0062O7L7S/">Training From the Back of the Room</a>, and use lots of the ideas from there for <a href="https://railsbridgecapetown.org/activities.html">bits and pieces of RailsBridge</a>. I finally made some time to look at one of Sharon Bowman&rsquo;s other books: <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Ten-Minute-Trainer-Teach-Quick-Stick-ebook/dp/B008L01FOQ">The Ten-Minute Trainer</a>.</p>
<p>As I did with TFTBOTR, I went through and made myself flash cards of the activities and other big ideas that particularly interested me.</p>
<p><a href="https://naga.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ttmt.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-1425"><img src="https://naga.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ttmt-400x331.jpg" alt="ttmt" width="400" height="331" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1425" /></a></p>
<p>I got a lot from the book, but one particular theme that I appreciated was <strong>being reminded of the specific brain-related reasons</strong> for doing things in certain ways.</p>
<ul>
<li>Teaching someone else a thing you&rsquo;ve just learned makes you remember it for longer.</li>
<li>Spending more time discussing new things makes for better linking of the knowledge between your old and new knowledge, which in turn leads to deeper understanding and longer retention.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using images a lot in training stuff, but I was reminded that I needn&rsquo;t take it quite so literally. It&rsquo;s not just illustrations and photos: you can use <strong>mental images created by metaphors and stories</strong> for the same effect. I&rsquo;m also keen to see where and how I can introduce <strong>graphic organisers</strong> into the training I do.</p>
<p>Another thing that I haven&rsquo;t been doing much of is kinesthetic stuff: <strong>linking ideas and concepts to body movement</strong>, which lets people learn things more quickly, increases recall and attention, and helps move the ideas into long term memory.</p>
<h3 id="go-buy-and-and-read-it-">Go buy and and read it!</h3>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t read either, I recommend starting with TTMT, then moving on to TFTBOTR. Both have lots of good stuff, but TFTBOTR feels like a refinement, iterative improvement, and clarification of the ideas.</p>
<p>If you can only read one, I recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Training-Back-Room-Aside-Learn-ebook/dp/B0062O7L7S/">TFTBOTR</a>. It feels slightly tighter, and I found the large volume of activities in TTMT a bit overwhelming and sometimes slightly repetitive.</p>
