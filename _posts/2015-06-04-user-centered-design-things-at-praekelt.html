<p>It's been a busy few weeks. Justin and I have been continuing our work on various bits of User Experience things for <a href="http://vumi.org/">Vumi</a>, the massive messaging application that powers a lot of USSD and SMS campaigns.</p>
<p>The team decided that we should share our some of work with the wider world, so I volunteered to write up some blog posts about what we've done. The first post in the series, <a href="http://blog.vumi.org/post/120522697105/user-centered-design-and-personas">User-Centered Design and Personas</a>, was published on Tuesday 2nd June.</p>
<p>Feedback welcome!</p>
