I like doing end-of-year reflections. I like seeing what I did, and what I learned.

Previous years: [2023 review](/2023/12/28/year-in-review/) and [2022 review](/2022/12/27/2022-year-in-review/).

## New job

In April I joined [Intopia](https://intopia.digital/) as a Digital Accessibility Consultant. Having been a client of theirs for a while, and because the accessibility industry's quite small, I knew some of the people there already. They are cool cats (by which I mean lovely people) who really know their stuff.

As usual, the first few (maybe six (maybe more)) months were (/are) pretty tiring. Adjusting to new people and places and routines and rhythms, learning new systems and things. It's nice to be back doing consulting kind of work again. I think the mixing-it-up is a good fit for my kind of brain.

Being part of Intopia also meant that I went to Australia for the first time, for about a week. I was in Melbourne for [A11yCamp](https://a11ycamp.com.au/), and a took a few extra days to hang around town afterwards. I really liked Melbourne, I'd like to go back for longer. I had fun scribbling [cheeky little sketchnotes for some of the talks](/2024/10/28/my-sketchnotes-from-a11ycamp-2024/).

## Speaking

Just two things, but both pleasing and enjoyable.

In April I was back on my bullshit at [Code Camp Wellington 2024](https://www.codecampwellington.nz/speakers/steve-barnett.html), doing a lightning talk about **Difficulty levels in Elden Ring and what they can teach us about web accessibility**. (The year before I did a lightning talk "Dungeons and Dragons and Accessibility") Here's [a blog post version of the talk](/2024/04/08/difficulty-levels-in-elden-ring-and-what-they-can-teach-us-about-web-accessibility/). I hope to be back there in 2025 with another weird lightning talk, using some other peculiar thing to help us people understand accessibility.

I did one all-day workshop in June for the NZ Testing Conf: [Accessibility testing: Busting barriers with ARIAs, axes, and audits](https://nztestingconf.nz/accessibility-testing-workshop). I really enjoyed flexing my facilitation skills again. It was a small but keen crowd. They gave me some great feedback, which I really appreciated.

## Writing

I [wrote a little over 10 posts in 2024](/archive/2024/). I spend more time than that writing, though: I did a lot of prep work for the conference workshop, pulling together existing bits of work (like the [MAP](/more-accessible-products/)), updating some older ones (like [Form and error guidelines](/2024/06/18/form-and-error-guidelines/) and [Accessibility audit process](/2024/06/16/accessibility-audit-process/)), and writing some new ones.

While I was at MSD, I continued to write more about people and process, efficiency and efficacy. Things like:

- [high quality feedback](/2024/01/24/the-crit-stick-high-quality-feedback/);     
- [knowing when to quit (an audit)](/2024/02/20/knowing-when-to-quit-an-audit/)
- [framing](/2024/02/17/the-importance-of-the-frame/)
- [limiting WIP](/2024/02/06/limiting-work-in-progress/)

I'm glad I tried my hand at government work. But/and I think it's unlikely I'll go back.

## Values

Back in 2022 I took a moment to [reflect and write up my values and tasks I like doing](/2022/12/27/2022-year-in-review/#reflecting), and put them on the home page ([values](/#values) and [types](/#enjoy)). I've come back to these quite often over the past year or two. They've been a useful compass / guide / navigational heading when I've been feeling a bit lost or unsure.

## That's a wrap!

I'd quite like to write a bit more next year. And I'm keen to get back into presenting and facilitating a bit more. Early in 2025 I'll start plotting and scheming. Let's see how it goes.
