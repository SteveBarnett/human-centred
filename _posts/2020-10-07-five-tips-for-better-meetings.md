Like many people, over the years I've been in a lot of meetings. Here are five things that I've found tend to make for better meetings.

- 🙋‍♀️ **Facilitator**. To help us stay on topic and stay on time. (Example: jazz hands to signal off topic)
- 📅 **Agenda**. So we know why we’re there and what our goal is. (Can be only one thing!)
- 👍 **Ground rules**. So we know what we can expect from each other. (Examples: [the retrospective prime directive](https://www.retrospectivewiki.org/index.php?title=The_Prime_Directive), phone use outside the room only)
- 🤫 **Silent brainstorming**. To let all the ideas surface, and to let everyone have their say. (Usually with sticky notes)
- 🖼 **Visual note taking**. To record what happened. Visual because images are better for memory and understanding. (Ideas, not art: doesn't have to be fancy!)

That's it!
