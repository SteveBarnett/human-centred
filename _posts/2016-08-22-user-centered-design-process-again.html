<p>Every now and then I go back to my scribbled picture of my UCD process and I think about wobbling it a bit. I spent some time looking at it recently. I added a bunch of stuff, I deleted a bunch of stuff, and I ended up with a slightly adjusted version.</p>
<p>Here it is:</p>

<p>I still keep the focus on the UX and Front-end side of things, since that’s where I work most of the time. I’ve added research to the plan phase of the picture. It’s been implied before, but I thought it was important to have it shown as it’s own, separate, step. I also added Impact Mapping as I think it’s a great tool.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick list of why we need each step.</p>
<ul>
<li>Research: for gathering data on the problem.</li>
<li>Problem Frame Diagram: for finding the overlap of user needs, business needs, and skills of the team.</li>
<li>Personas: for clarity on who our users are.</li>
<li>Journey Map: for the path our users take and how they interact with the system.</li>
<li>Impact Map: for a clear strategic direction and metrics for success.</li>
<li>Sketches: for content and its priority on the page.</li>
<li>Prototypes and Usability testing: for validating our solution.</li>
<li>Style Tiles: for establishing design direction.</li>
<li>Front-end Style Guide: for responsive, consistent, and maintainable front-end code.</li>
<li>Analytics and Usability testing: for continuing to validate our solution.</li>
</ul>
