I’m uncovering better ways of working with other humans.

Through this work I have come to value:

<ul class="hccm">
	<li id="specific"><strong>being specific</strong> over being generic;</li>
	<li id="positive"><strong>focusing on positives</strong> over picking out negatives;</li>
	<li id="future"><strong>orienting towards the future</strong> over dwelling on the past;</li>
	<li id="open"><strong>being open</strong> over being closed;</li>
	<li id="spectrum"><strong>thinking of things as on a spectrum</strong> over thinking of things as binaries;</li>
	<li id="efficient"><strong>being efficient</strong> over being wasteful;</li>
	<li id="constructive"><strong>being constructive</strong> over being destructive;</li>
	<li id="connection"><strong>fostering connection</strong> over creating division;</li>
</ul>

That is, while there is value in the items at the start of each bullet, I value the items at the end of the bullet more.

Note: there are eight items in this list. This lets them fit nicely into a 3x3 bingo board, with a star in the middle! ⭐️

This is a dorky riff on [the Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/).
It also contains a swirling mixing pot of things from [Radical Candour](https://www.radicalcandor.com/), self-awareness (particularly as discussed in [Tara Eurich's book Insight](https://insight-book.com/)), and [Clean Language as discussed by Judy Rees](https://judyrees.co.uk/2018/10/04/six-baby-steps-to-start-using-clean-language/).
