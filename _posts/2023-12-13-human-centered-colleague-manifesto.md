I’m uncovering better ways of working with other humans.

Through this work I have come to value:

- **being specific** over being generic;
- **focusing on positives** over picking out negatives;
- **orienting towards the future** over dwelling on the past;
- **being open** over being closed;
- **thinking of things as on a spectrum** over thinking of things as binaries;
- **being efficient** over being wasteful;
- **being constructive** over being destructive;
- **fostering connection** over creating division;

That is, while there is value in the items at the start of each bullet, I value the items at the end of the bullet more.

Note: there are eight items in this list. This lets them fit nicely into a 3x3 bingo board, with a star in the middle! ⭐️

This is a dorky riff on [the Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/).
It also contains a swirling mixing pot of things from [Radical Candour](https://www.radicalcandor.com/), self-awareness (particularly as discussed in [Tara Eurich's book Insight](https://insight-book.com/)), and [Clean Language as discussed by Judy Rees](https://judyrees.co.uk/2018/10/04/six-baby-steps-to-start-using-clean-language/).
