<p>I finally got around to reading <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/11/24/how-to-create-your-own-front-end-website-testing-plan/">How To Create Your Own Front-End Website Testing Plan</a> and that got me a bit angry talking about support levels. The article steers towards a binary way of thinking: <strong>have / have not</strong> and <strong>supported / unsupported</strong>, and I think that’s not quite right. The way that users will experience a site sits on a continuum, and it’s not for us to tell them that their browser is or isn’t “good enough.”</p>
<p>I’m going to pick on the Smashing Mag article a little. Sorry.</p>
<blockquote><p>Support level 2: partially supported browsers and devices</p></blockquote>
<p>The turn of phrase here is a little off for me. It’s not that they are partially supported: it’s more that they’re full supported for a different experience. The article also talks about degradation instead of enhancement. I’d much rather build with Progressive Enhancement: a tasty base, with goodness layered on top.</p>
<blockquote><p>Support level 3: unsupported browsers and devices</p></blockquote>
<p>Ideally there should be no such thing as an unsupported browser or device. Every browser should get a functional experience, even if it’s not fancy.</p>
