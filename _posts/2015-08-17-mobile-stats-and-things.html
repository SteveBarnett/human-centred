<p>Every quarter ScientiaMobile publishes a <a href="http://www.scientiamobile.com/page/movr-mobile-overview-report">Mobile Overview Report</a>, which always has some interesting stats. I look through it because I want to be aware of what kind of devices people over the world are using, and I want to keep <a href="http://devicelab.co.za/the-lab.php#devicesinthelab">the device lab up to date</a>. Here are a few highlights that caught my eye.</p>
<h2 id="featurephonebrowsingstillabout12ofmobileuse.">Feature phone browsing is (still) about 12% of mobile use</h2>
<p>The split between form factors in Africa is 12% feature phone, 62% smartphone, and 26% tablet. Feature phone browsing on other continents is in the single digits, and rapidly dwindling. </p>
<p>This is important to keep in mind because feature phones don&#8217;t have great support for fancy CSS and JS. In fact, <a href="http://stevebarnett.github.io/fufu/dos-and-donts.html">they don&#8217;t have great support for older CSS and JS</a>.</p>
<h2 id="thereisnofold">There is no fold</h2>
<p>Scrolling is a natural, easy, action on smartphones. People are more likely to scroll if a page takes more than a few seconds to load. Luke W has more <a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1946">great stats and research</a> on this.</p>
<p>This makes me wonder about the many sites that have a large image (or auto-playing video) in the header: how many people scroll right past it (at least on the first visit)?</p>
<h2 id="androidishuge">Android is huge</h2>
<p>iOS takes up 33% of the global market (with Android taking up most of the rest), but the picture closer to home is a bit different. Africa has only 8% iOS (Europe and North America are at 32% and 47%, respectively), 8% on Windows phone (more than the rest of the world, but dropping), a staggering 79% Android, and 5% for the rest.</p>
<p>In terms of Android versions across the world, various flavours of 4 take up most of the market, with older version taking up only single digits. </p>
<p>For me, this means updating the device lab with another Android phone that fits the specs of popular locals devices: cheap, fairly low power, but running a version of Android 4 (one of Vodafone&#8217;s Smart 4 devices or one of the MTN Steppa family).</p>
