<p>The recent rise of responsive design has highlighted the need for a refocusing on performance. Sites in general have definitely seen an increase in weight, but I don't think that Responsive sites are inherently heavier: at least, they don't have to be. Here are a couple of recent articles looking at performance as it relates to Responsive design.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://clearleft.com/thinks/responsivedesignonabudget/">Responsive Design on a Budget on the Clearleft blog</a> has an excellent idea: set a budget for page size. Doing so forces you to consider the cost / benefit of each addition and think about the relative importance of assets in/on the page.</li>
<li>Brad Frost has a great article, <a href="http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/post/performance-as-design/">Performance As Design</a>, on his blog. In it, he suggests that performance should be considered as part of the design: good performance is good design.</li>
<li>Tim Kadlec follows up with <a href="http://timkadlec.com/2013/01/setting-a-performance-budget/">Setting a Performance Budget</a>, and talks more about setting a performance budget.</li>
</ul>
<p>This idea of more integrated areas, where each phase of development has little bits of everything, is becoming more widespread. Another good example is security: it should ideally be part of the project specification. <a href="https://naga.co.za/2012/09/24/built-in-not-bolted-on-web-application-security-done-right/">Security should be built-in, not bolted on</a>. I think this ties in well with the move to more iterative, short cycle, development processes.</p>
