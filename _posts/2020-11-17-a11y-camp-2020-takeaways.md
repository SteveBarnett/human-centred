I managed to catch a few of the talks at this year’s [A11y Camp](https://a11ycamp.org.au/). Here are three of my top takeaways from three of the talks. The first one in each list is something I’ve turned into a TODO for myself at my current job.

### [Alexis Lucio: From Nothing to Something: How A Team of 2 Kickstarted an Accessibility](https://a11ycamp.org.au/program/presentations/from-nothing-to-something-how-a-team-of-2-kickstarted-an-accessibility-program/)

- **Have a11y one-page guidelines (for bite-size learnings)**
- Have a monthly a11y hour (to share some knowledge)
- Benchmark everything (so you can see improvement)

## [Ross Mullen: Not another checklist! – A testing methodology which explains the what and how of manual accessibility testing](https://a11ycamp.org.au/program/presentations/not-another-checklist-a-testing-methodology-which-explains-the-what-and-how-of-manual-accessibility-testing/)

- **Distill WCAG into something easier to test**
- Test should have a clear pass / fail / not applicable result
- If your organisations a11y maturity is low, start with just a few tests to set a baseline

## [Stewart Hay: How to create a kick ass business case for accessibility](https://a11ycamp.org.au/program/presentations/how-to-create-a-kick-ass-business-case-for-accessibility/)

- **The more hooks you have for accessibility, the better (more convincing)**
- Remember that a business case is a decision-making tool (demonstrate a clear business benefit)
- Align with business strategy, reduce costs (show that fixing earlier is quicker and cheaper)
