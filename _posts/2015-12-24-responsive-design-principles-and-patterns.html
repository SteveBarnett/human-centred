<p>One of the many books that I marked for holiday reading was <a href="http://unstoppablerobotninja.com/">Ethan Marcotte</a>&rsquo;s latest book: <a href="http://abookapart.com/products/responsive-design-patterns-principles">Responsive Design: Principles and Patterns</a>. It&rsquo;s a nice mix of specific patterns and lofty principles. As I sometimes do, I made some sketchnotes as I read through.</p>
<p>Marcotte talks about modular design and creating a network of small layout systems.</p>
<p>When we make assumptions, we should assume the worst (smallest screen, slowest network, and so on), and add enhancements from there.</p>
<p><a href="https://naga.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/rdpp1-c.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-1400"><img src="https://naga.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/rdpp1-c-400x299.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="299" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1400" /></a></p>
<p>He also talks about the UCD (User-centered design) importance of prototyping, and getting our work in front of users early and often. In talking about frameworks such as <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> and <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation</a>, he talks about using those for (throw away code) prototypes, but not for production code.</p>
<p>Marcotte puts forward <strong>width</strong>, <strong>heirarchy</strong>, <strong>interaction</strong>, and <strong>density</strong>, as things to look at for finding the seams in our components: when do things change, how, and why?</p>

<p>I tried something a little different with the sketch notes this time: colouring in. Here are the black and white originals: <a href="https://naga.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/rdpp1.jpg">one</a> and <a href="https://naga.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/rdpp2.jpg">two</a>. I think that I overdid it a bit with the colour. Next time I&rsquo;ll pick one or two colours, and use those for adding highlight, shadows, and things like that.</p>
