Last week and the week before was [A11y Camp](https://a11ycamp.org.au). Yay! Below are sketchnotes I made for some of the talks, with my top takeaway for each.

## Day one

### Accessible Player Experiences - Designing For All Players by Steven Weitz

<div markdown="1">
- Gaming help combat social isolation, create social connection
- Players with disabilities play: a variety of games; together.
- Every player is different.
- It's about removing barriers.
- APX (Accessible Player Experience) has Access Patterns and Challenge Patterns. The format:
	- Symbol
	- Snappy name
	- Design problem
	- Design drivers
	- Design solution
- Difficulty modes are just packages of settings.
</div>
</details>

My top takeaway: **difficulty modes are just packages of settings.** Make granular settings first, then package them up together if it helps.

<div markdown="1">
- More complicated code means more opportunities for problems.
- Write your tests from your users perspective.
- Everyone makes mistakes: let machines (e.g. linting) tell people off (instead of other people).
- Accessibility is a mindset, not a standalone activity.
</div>
</details>

My top takeaway: **let machines tell people off instead of other people.**

<div markdown="1">
- Give people a chance to safely challenge their own assumptions.
- Have the instructor embedded in the video, no box. It helps with understandability, comprehension.
- Off-the-shelf training can't be integrated like custom can.
</div>
</details>

My top takeaway: **give people a chance to safely challenge their own assumptions.**

		- Activity
	- sensory inputs
	- emotional state
	- delivery mode
- People learn by forming connections.

My top takeaway: **people learn by forming connections.**

### Mobile Accessibility Testing - Making It Effective And Efficient For Everyone by Rob Whitaker

[![Sketchnotes for "Mobile Accessibility Testing - Making It Effective And Efficient For Everyone".

<div markdown="1">
- [Mobile A11y.com](https://mobilea11y.com/)
- Essential testing:
	- User testing
	- Manual testing. Set up shortcuts and captions for mobile screen readers.
- Testing that saves time, effort, and money:
	- Scanning
	- Automated testing
	- Linting
- For automated tests:
	- Fail? Investigate!
	- Pass? Maybe double-check.
</div>
</details>

My top takeaway: **treat automated test failures as flags for things to investigate.**

### Paying Down Your Debt, Third Party Ui Controls, And Accessibility Half-truths by Ross Mullen

[![Sketchnotes for "Paying Down Your Debt, Third Party Ui Controls, And Accessibility Half-truths".

<div markdown="1">
- It's easy to increase complexity by using UI libraries. High complexity means high risk.
- Check UI library vendor claims. Assume the worst.
- Indicators of confidence::
	- Accessibility Statement
	- Blogs
	- Accessibility champion
	- GitHub
- Better indicators:
	- Independent Check
	- Accessibility Personas
</div>
</details>

My top takeaway: **independent checks and Accessibility Personas are good indicators.**

I also did a talk: [Sounds like a good idea: how to get started testing with a screen reader](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqjkSjZOUSI). I've also written up [a text-y version of the talk](/2022/10/15/sounds-like-a-good-idea/).
