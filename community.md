I like hosting and attending meetups, and usually have a side project or two on the go. I really enjoy running workshops and giving talks. In particular, I love [Training from the Back of the Room](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8141935-training-from-the-back-of-the-room), and I secretly(ish) try and make every talk I do into somewhat of a workshop. I like asking people to Do Stuff to help them learn a bit more. I read and think a lot about teaching and learning, and keep [a checklist of sorts](/writing-workshops-and-talks/) that I use whenever making a new workshop.

### Hosting meetups

From October 2012 until July 2018, I was one of the organisers of the Cape Town Front-end Developers (now [FEDSA](https://fedsa.org/) (Front-end Development South Africa)) meetup group. The group [hosts monthly events](http://www.meetup.com/ctfeds/) such as talks and workshops.

With a lot of help from some friends, I started the [Cape Town chapter](https://railsbridgecapetown.org/) of [RailsBridge](http://railsbridge.org/): an organisation that offers free workshops on Rails, Ruby, and other web technologies for groups of people that are underrepresented in tech. From April 2013 until March 2018, I helped organise and mentor at the quarterly workshops.

Near the start of 2018 I realised I was overdoing things a bit and taking on too much. I decided to take a break from being in an organiser role, and focus more on giving talks and workshops. That didn't stop me from doing some mentoring at [ColorCode](https://colorcode.org.za/) (a consistent, inclusive, community for learning to solve problems with code) every few weeks, though!

### Projects

I think that a great way to test the robustness and resilience of your site is to play with it on lower-end mobile devices. I joined the [Open Device Lab](http://opendevicelab.com/) community by starting the [Nomad Device Lab](http://devicelab.co.za/) in September 2012. It&#8217;s a shared pool of internet-connected devices, and is free to use. Every few months someone will contact me through the site and I&#8217;ll go and sit with them, usually for a half a day. We test their projects across a range of devices, and discuss ways of improving the front-end performance and user experience. In November 2016, the lab was featured on Smashing Mag: [Where Are The Worldâ€™s Best Open Device Labs?](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/11/worlds-best-open-device-labs/). The lab closed its doors in February 2019.

I&#8217;m a big believer in building things that are Future Friendly, so I made [a tiny site](http://futurefriendly.co.za/) to join the call to arms. You can read more about the technical details of what that means on my [How I Do Things](http://naga.co.za/how-i-do-things/) page.
