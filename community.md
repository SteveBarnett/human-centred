I like hosting and attending meetups, and usually have a side project or two on the go. I really enjoy running workshops and giving talks. In particular, I love [Training from the Back of the Room](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8141935-training-from-the-back-of-the-room), and I secretly(ish) try and make every talk I do into somewhat of a workshop. I like asking people to Do Stuff to help them learn a bit more. I read and think a lot about teaching and learning, and keep [a checklist of sorts](/writing-workshops-and-talks/) that I use whenever making a new workshop.

## Hosting meetups

From October 2012 until July 2018, I was one of the organisers of the Cape Town Front-end Developers (now [FEDSA](https://fedsa.org/) (Front-end Development South Africa)) meetup group. The group [hosts monthly events](http://www.meetup.com/ctfeds/) such as talks and workshops.

With a lot of help from some friends, I started the [Cape Town chapter](https://railsbridgecapetown.org/) of [RailsBridge](http://railsbridge.org/): an organisation that offers free workshops on Rails, Ruby, and other web technologies for groups of people that are underrepresented in tech. From April 2013 until March 2018, I helped organise and mentor at the quarterly workshops.

Near the start of 2018 I realised I was overdoing things a bit and taking on too much. I decided to take a break from being in an organiser role, and focus more on giving talks and workshops. That didn't stop me from doing some mentoring at [ColorCode](https://colorcode.org.za/) (a consistent, inclusive, community for learning to solve problems with code) every few weeks, though!
