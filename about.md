Steve has been building things for the web professionally since 2005. In the past few years he’s worked as a Front-end developer and UX person at [Unboxed Consulting](https://unboxed.co/), [Flow](http://www.userexperience.co.za/) (now part of Deloitte Digital), and [Praekelt Foundation](http://praekelt.org/). He’s also worked as a code mentor at [codeX](http://www.projectcodex.co/), helping people learn Front-end and Back-end development. At the moment he’s a Front-end development and User Experience consultant, working with small, lovely, teams. He especially likes working on projects that are open source, that help people, and that have a South African flavor.

He’s worked on the Front-end of projects across various tech stacks (Rails, Django, .NET MVC, Ember, WordPress) building templates and Front-end Style Guides. He’s set up and used task runners like Gulp and Grunt, and used pre-processors like Sass and Less. He’s made UX deliverables like Personas and Journey Maps, conducted usability reviews, and run usability tests.

He loves helping people learn new things and being involved with the dev community. He’s involved in organising [CTFEDs](http://ctfeds.org/) (Cape Town front-end developers: a monthly meetup group that does talks and workshops) and [RailsBridge Cape Town](https://railsbridgecapetown.org/) (quarterly Ruby on Rails workshops). He runs occasional [Open Device Lab](http://opendevicelab.com/) sessions around Cape Town with his [Nomad Device Lab](http://devicelab.co.za/).

He loves sharing what he learns, so he writes about it here (and [cross-posts to Medium](https://medium.com/@maxbarners)), speaks at conferences, and facilitates workshops. You can read a bit more about these things on his [community page](https://naga.co.za/community/). If he’s not busy with one of those, he’s probably crouched in an awkward position in front of something funny-looking, [taking pictures of it](https://www.instagram.com/maxbarners/).


He’s on Twitter as [@maxbarners](https://twitter.com/maxbarners), on GitHub as [SteveBarnett](https://github.com/SteveBarnett/), on [LinkedIn](https://za.linkedin.com/in/steve-barnett-2a924a4a), and here as, erm, himself.

He loves open source so he keeps lots of things on GitHub like [the contract he uses](https://github.com/SteveBarnett/Contract), [the questions he asks clients](https://github.com/SteveBarnett/Client-Questionnaire), a [template for lightweight UX Personas](https://github.com/SteveBarnett/Personas-Template), [checklists for UX and accessibility](https://github.com/SteveBarnett/Checklists), [retrospective templates](https://github.com/SteveBarnett/Freelancer-Friday-Flections).


You can drop him a line at hello@naga.co.za. Sometimes he writes about himself things in the third person and it feels a bit odd ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯.
