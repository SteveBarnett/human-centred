![](/img/SteveBarnett.jpg){:.pull-right}

Steve Barnett is a **front-end developer and user experience consultant**. He loves the One Web and applying user-centered design principles to front-end development.

He's been building things for the web professionally since 2005 (and built things for fun for a while before that). In the past few years he’s worked as a front-end developer and UX person at [Unboxed Consulting](https://unboxed.co/), [Flow](http://www.userexperience.co.za/) (now part of Deloitte Digital), and [Praekelt Foundation](http://praekelt.org/). He’s also worked as a code mentor at [codeX](http://www.projectcodex.co/), helping people learn front-end and back-end development.

He works on the front-end of projects across various tech stacks (Rails, Django, .NET MVC, Ember, WordPress) building templates and front-end Style Guides. He sets up and uses task runners like Gulp and Grunt, and uses [pre-processors like Sass](/2015/03/20/getting-into-sass/) and Less to make CSS a bit friendlier to use. He makes UX deliverables like [Personas](http://localhost:4000/2015/06/04/user-centered-design-things-at-praekelt/) and [Journey Maps](http://localhost:4000/2015/06/15/more-user-centered-design-things-at-praekelt/), conducts usability reviews, and [runs usability tests](/2017/09/07/talking-to-people-thoughts-on-usability-testing/).

He’s a bit addicted to meetups and community things. He loves sharing what he learns, so [he writes about it here](/archive/) (and [cross-posts to Medium](https://medium.com/@maxbarners)), speaks at conferences, and facilitates workshops. You can read a bit more about this on his [community page](https://naga.co.za/community/). If he’s not busy with one of those, he’s probably crouched in an awkward position in front of something funny-looking, [taking pictures of it](https://www.instagram.com/maxbarners/).

### Out there on the web

He’s on Twitter as [@maxbarners](https://twitter.com/maxbarners), on GitHub as [SteveBarnett](https://github.com/SteveBarnett/), on [LinkedIn](https://za.linkedin.com/in/steve-barnett-2a924a4a), and here as, erm, himself.

He loves open source so he keeps lots of things on GitHub like [the contract he uses](https://github.com/SteveBarnett/Contract), [the questions he asks clients](https://github.com/SteveBarnett/Client-Questionnaire), [a template for lightweight UX Personas](https://github.com/SteveBarnett/Personas-Template), [checklists for UX and accessibility](https://github.com/SteveBarnett/Checklists), and [retrospective templates](https://github.com/SteveBarnett/Freelancer-Friday-Flections).

You can drop him a line at hello@naga.co.za. Sometimes he writes about himself things in the third person and it feels a bit odd ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯.
