He's been building things for the web professionally since 2005 (and built things for fun for a while before that). In Cape Town in South Africa he worked as a front-end developer and UX person (as an employee and as a consultant) at dev shops, design studios, and more. In January 2020 he moved to Wellington in New Zealand and joined [Totara Learning](https://www.totaralearning.com/) as a front-end developer, specialising in accessibility. In August 2021 he started at [Xero](https://www.xero.com/) as a Technical Digital Accessibility Analyst. In September 2023 he started at the [Ministry of Social Development](https://msd.govt.nz/) as a Digital Accessibility Specialist. In April 2024 he started at [Intopia](https://intopia.digital/) as a Digital Accessibility Consultant.

## Elsewhere

You can find him on [GitHub as SteveBarnett](https://github.com/SteveBarnett/), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/steve-barnett/), and, erm, here.

He loves open source so he keeps lots of things on GitHub like [accessibility demos and tests](https://github.com/SteveBarnett/a11y-demos-and-tests), [notes-to-self on the WebAim Million](https://github.com/SteveBarnett/WebAIM-Million), [retrospective templates](https://github.com/SteveBarnett/Freelancer-Friday-Flections), and [checklists for UX and accessibility](https://github.com/SteveBarnett/Checklists).

You can drop him a line at [steve@naga.co.za](mailto:steve@naga.co.za). Sometimes he writes things about himself in the third person and it feels a bit odd<span aria-hidden="true"> ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯</span>.
