He's been building things for the web professionally since 2005 (and built things for fun for a while before that). In the past few years he's worked as a front-end developer and UX person at [Unboxed Consulting](https://unboxed.co/), [Flow](http://www.userexperience.co.za/) (now part of Deloitte Digital), and [Praekelt Foundation](http://praekelt.org/). He's also worked as a code mentor at [codeX](http://www.projectcodex.co/), helping people learn front-end and back-end development. In October 2016, he went back to consulting full-time. Since then, he's worked with teams at [Vulcan Labs](http://www.vulcanlabs.com/), [Fire and Lion](https://fireandlion.com), [Code Collective](https://codecollective.com/), [Isoflow](http://isoflow.co.za/), [SnapScan](http://www.snapscan.co.za/) and more.
