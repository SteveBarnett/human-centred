Hi, I'm Steve Barnett.

I help software teams **have happier customers** and **make better software**. The best way to do this is by becoming **more user-centered**.
{: .lede }

It provides your business with a competitive advantage: your site is faster and reaches more people. I design and build sites and apps that everyone can use, regardless of their device, the network they’re on, or any disabilities they might have. I do this by by designing and building in a future friendly way, and I can help your team do it too.

<a href="https://naga.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/workshop-opening.jpg"><img src="https://naga.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/workshop-opening-400x225.jpg" alt="workshop-opening" width="400" height="225" class="pull-left pop-left" /></a>

I do **front-end development and user experience work**. That means I’m somewhere between the worlds of back-end development and graphic design: I talk code stuff with the developers and I talk design stuff with the designers. The UX of side of things covers what should be built, and the FED side covers how it should be built.

I can be most helpful to **small teams teams (of mostly back-end developers) who want to get started with, or want a little help with, front-end and user experience goodness**. I particularly like working on projects that are open source, that help people, and that have a South African flavor.

### How I can help

Becoming an excellent user-centered team doesn’t happen overnight. Old habits die hard and figuring out what users need (rather than what they say they want) is tricky. I help teams find and make the small changes that will make a big, lasting, impact to help them in their journey. Things I do:

<a href="https://naga.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/point-and-explain.jpg"><img src="https://naga.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/point-and-explain-400x265.jpg" alt="point-and-explain" width="400" height="265" class="pull-right pop-right" /></a>

- run short, focused, workshops on areas of FED or UX;
- work directly with teams on a project;
- make first version of UX deliverables with teams (like Personas and Journey Maps);
- help make a clear business case for spending more time on the front-end and user experience.

I also help teams set themselves up for making continuous improvements in future by picking up bits of work that they don’t have capacity for, then walking them through what I did, how I did it, and why I made the choices I did. I help back-end developers learn more about the front-end, help front-end developers learn more about UX, and help both to write better, faster, more widely supported code.

### What next?

If I haven’t worked with you before, I usually like to do a small project first. This gives you a chance to see that you're happy with my work and check that we're a good fit for working together.

If this sounds good, drop me a line on hello@naga.co.za.
