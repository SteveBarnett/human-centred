## What next?

You can read more about [how I can help](/how-i-can-help/) or [my background](/about/). You can drop me a line at [hello@naga.co.za](mailto:hello@naga.co.za). I'll probably [ask you about time, scope, and cost](https://github.com/SteveBarnett/Client-Questionnaire#client-questionnaire).

If I havenâ€™t worked with you before, I usually like us to do a small project first. This gives you a chance to see that you're happy with my work and check that we work well together.
