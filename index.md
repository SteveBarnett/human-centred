Hi, I'm Steve Barnett.

![](/img/SteveBarnett.jpg){:.pull-right}

I'm a **front-end developer and user experience consultant**. I help software teams **have happier customers and make better software**.
{: .lede }

I do this by helping your team become **more user-centered**. That provides your business with a competitive advantage: your site is faster and reaches more people on more browsers. I design and build sites and apps in a future friendly way, with an eye towards inclusive design and accessibility. That means a site that everyone can use, regardless of their device, the network they’re on, or any disabilities they might have. I can help your team do it too.

I do **front-end development** and **user experience** work. That means I’m somewhere between the worlds of back-end development and interface design: I talk tests and code with the developers and I talk typography and colours with the designers. The UX of side of things covers what should be built, and the FED side covers how it should be built.

I can be most helpful to **small teams teams (of mostly back-end developers) who want to get started with, or want a little help with, front-end and user experience goodness**. I particularly like working on projects that are open source, that help people, and that have a South African flavour. Practically, this means that I do some of the work, coach others on some of it, and run short, focused, workshops on FED and UX topics.

## What next?

You can read more about [how I can help](/how-i-can-help/) or [my background](/about/). You can drop me a line at [hello@naga.co.za](mailto:hello@naga.co.za). I'll probably [ask you about time, scope, and cost](https://github.com/SteveBarnett/Client-Questionnaire#client-questionnaire).

If I haven’t worked with you before, I usually like us to do a small project first. This gives you a chance to see that you're happy with my work and check that we work well together.
