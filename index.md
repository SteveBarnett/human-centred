Hi, I'm Steve Barnett.

I help software teams **have happier customers** and **make better software**. The best way to do this is by becoming **more user-centered**.

It provides your business with a competitive advantage: your site is faster and reaches more people. I design and build sites and apps that **everyone can use, regardless of their device, the network they’re on, or any disabilities they might have**. I do this by by designing and building in a future friendly way, and I can help your team do it too.

I do **Front-end development and User Experience work**. That means I’m somewhere between the worlds of back-end development and graphic design: I talk code stuff with the developers and I talk design stuff with the designers. The UX of side of things covers what should be built, and the FED side covers how it should be built.

### How I can help

Becoming an excellent User-centered team doesn’t happen overnight. I help teams find and make the small changes that will make a big, lasting, impact to help them in  their journey. I help them level up with short, focused workshops, or by working directly with them on a project. I help them make a clear business case clear for spending more time on the Front-end and User Experience.

I also help teams set themselves up for making continuous improvements in future by picking up bits of work that they don’t have capacity for, then walking them through what I did, how I did it, and why I made the choices I did. I help back-end developers learn more about the front-end, help front-end developers learn more about UX, and help both to write better, faster, more widely supported code.

If I haven’t worked with you before, I usually like to do a small project first. This gives you a chance to see that you're happy with my work and check that we're a good fit for working together.

If this sounds good to you, drop me a line on hello@naga.co.za.
