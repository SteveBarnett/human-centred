Hi, I'm Steve Barnett.

I help software teams **have happier customers** and **make better software**. The best way to do this is by becoming **more user-centered**.

It provides your business with a competitive advantage: your site is faster and reaches more people. I design and build sites and apps that everyone can use, regardless of their device, the network they’re on, or any disabilities they might have. I do this by by designing and building in a future friendly way, and I can help your team do it too.

I do **front-end development and user experience work**. That means I’m somewhere between the worlds of back-end development and graphic design: I talk code stuff with the developers and I talk design stuff with the designers. The UX of side of things covers what should be built, and the FED side covers how it should be built.

I can be most helpful to **small teams teams (of mostly back-end developers) who want to get started with, or want a little help with, front-end and user experience goodness**. I particularly like working on projects that are open source, that help people, and that have a South African flavor.
