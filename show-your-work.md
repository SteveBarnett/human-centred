title: Show Your Work
---

What are you working on? What's something interesting you've just learned? You don't have to give a long talk or run a workshop to share your knowledge and help other people learn something new. A 5 minute lightning talk will do!

Here's a handy template to **Show Your Work** to friends, family, or some colleagues.

## 1: Elevator Pitch

**Say why this is interesting, in one sentence.**

What's the takeaway for people listening? What problem does it solve, or what thing can they learn?

If you can't say it in one sentence, stop and think for a moment. Are you trying to cover too much? Just cover one thing, or one piece of a big thing, in some detail.

Are you not sure what to say? Tell us about how it saved you time, made something easier, or was something new to you.

## 2: Short demo

**Show the thing in action.**

Show us:

- A demo of the finished thing. Host it on the web somewhere that other people can access. You could try [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) or [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
- Behind the scenes: the source code or the structure of the design file. You might want to add comments as reminders for yourself and for us to read later.

One format for showing a thing that Front-end style guides often use: explanation, example, code sample.

## 3: Credit where it's due

**Tell us how and where you found out about this.**

One of the best things about our industry is the amount and awesomeness of the resources available. Did you find out about this thing on [Smashing Mag](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/), or [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/)? On Twitter from [Anna Debenham](https://twitter.com/anna_debenham) or [Sara Soueidan](https://twitter.com/SaraSoueidan)? Let us know so we can find more cool stuff too.

My turn for credit where it's due: the name of this and the push to get it going (again) came from reading [Austin Kleon](https://twitter.com/austinkleon)'s book [Show Your Work](https://austinkleon.com/show-your-work/).
