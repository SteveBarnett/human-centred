- Other things are higher priority.
- It’s boring, it’s not shiny or glamorous.
- It’s difficult. It’s easy to do ARIA wrong and make things worse.
- It’s takes too long.
- People with disabilities are not our target market.
- Only affects a small group of users.
- We don't have support to do it.
- It's only realistic / practical / possible on small projects.
- We can quickly add accessibility before the release.
- We can use an overlay.
- Web accessibility is just a developer's responsibility.
- Automated tools are enough.
- Compliance is enough.
- It’s all about ARIA.
