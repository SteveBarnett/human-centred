I do **front-end development** and **user experience** work. That means Iâ€™m somewhere between the worlds of back-end development and interface design: I write code and tests with the developers and make personas and wireframes with the designers. The UX side of things covers what should be built, and the FED side covers how it should be built.

I can be most helpful to **small teams teams (of mostly back-end developers) who want to get started with, or want a little help with, front-end and user experience goodness**. Practically, this means that I do some of the work, coach others on some of it, and run short, focused, workshops on FED and UX topics. I particularly like working on projects that are open source, that help people, and that have a South African flavour.
