I do **front-end development** and **user experience** work. That means Iâ€™m somewhere between the worlds of back-end development and interface design. I help bridge the gap between development and design by switching between my FED and UX roles as needed. I make personas and wireframes with the designers (what should we build?) and write code and tests with the developers (how should we build it?).
