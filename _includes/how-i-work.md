I **do the work as part of the team**, **coach others on some of it**, and **run short, focused, workshops** on FED and UX topics.

I like working on-site, quickly slotting with the team and their existing processes, for a few weeks or months. As an external party, though, I'm also well placed to ask awkward questions (in a gentle way) about existing processes and assumptions.

I prefer agile ways of working because I like the short feedback loops and focus on learning and improvement. I particularly like projects that are **open source**, that **help people**, and that have a **local flavour**.
