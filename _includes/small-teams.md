I can be most helpful to **small teams (of mostly back-end developers) who want a little help with front-end and user experience goodness**. I help people become more T-shaped, by learning a bit about the other side. I help back-end developers learn more about the front-end, help front-end developers learn more about UX, and help both to write more maintainable, more performant, more widely supported code. I help designers think more in HTML and CSS, and design more fluidly and flexibly for the modern, responsive, world.

I **do the work as part of the team**, **coach others on some of it**, and **run short, focused, workshops** on FED and UX topics. As an external party, I'm also well placed to **ask awkward questions** (in a gentle way) about existing processes and assumptions.

I like working on-site, quickly slotting in as a member of the team for a few weeks or months. I particularly like projects that are **open source**, that **help people**, and that have a **local flavour**.
