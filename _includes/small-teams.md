I can be most helpful to small teams (of mostly back-end developers) who want a little help with front-end and user experience goodness. I help:

- **people become more T-shaped**, by learning a bit about the other side;
- back-end developers learn more about the front-end, help front-end developers learn more about UX, and help both to write **more maintainable, more performant, more widely supported code**;
- designers think more in HTML and CSS, and **design more fluidly and flexibly** for the modern, responsive, world.
