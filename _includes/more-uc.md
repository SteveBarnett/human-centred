Doing so provides your business with a competitive advantage: your site is faster and reaches more people on more browsers. I design and develop sites and apps in a future friendly way: with an eye towards **inclusive design**, **accessibility**, and **performance**. That means a site that everyone can use, regardless of their device, the network theyâ€™re on, or any disabilities they might have. I can help your team do it too.
