<p>Steve has been building things for the web professionally since 2005. In the past few years he’s worked as a Front-end developer and UX person at <a href="https://unboxed.co/">Unboxed Consulting</a>, <a href="http://www.userexperience.co.za/">Flow</a> (now part of Deloitte Digital), and <a href="http://praekelt.org/">Praekelt Foundation</a>. He’s also worked as a code mentor at <a href="http://www.projectcodex.co/">codeX</a>, helping people learn Front-end and Back-end development. At the moment he’s a Front-end development and User Experience consultant, working with small, lovely, teams. He especially likes working on projects that are open source, that help people, and that have a South African flavor.</p>
<p>He’s worked on the Front-end of projects across various tech stacks (Rails, Django, .NET MVC, Ember, WordPress) building templates and Front-end Style Guides. He’s set up and used task runners like Gulp and Grunt, and used pre-processors like Sass and Less. He’s made UX deliverables like Personas and Journey Maps, conducted usability reviews, and run usability tests.</p>

<p>He loves helping people learn new things and being involved with the dev community. He’s involved in organising <a href="http://ctfeds.org/">CTFEDs</a> (Cape Town front-end developers: a monthly meetup group that does talks and workshops) and <a href="https://railsbridgecapetown.org/">RailsBridge Cape Town</a> (quarterly Ruby on Rails workshops). He runs occasional <a href="http://opendevicelab.com/">Open Device Lab</a> sessions around Cape Town with his <a href="http://devicelab.co.za/">Nomad Device Lab</a>.</p>
<p>He loves sharing what he learns, so he writes about it here (and <a href="https://medium.com/@maxbarners">cross-posts to Medium</a>), speaks at conferences, and facilitates workshops. You can read a bit more about these things on his <a href="https://naga.co.za/community/">community page</a>. If he’s not busy with one of those, he’s probably crouched in an awkward position in front of something funny-looking, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/maxbarners/">taking pictures of it</a>.</p>
<p>He’s on Twitter as <a href="https://twitter.com/maxbarners">@maxbarners</a>, on GitHub as <a href="https://github.com/SteveBarnett/">SteveBarnett</a>, on <a href="https://za.linkedin.com/in/steve-barnett-2a924a4a">LinkedIn</a>, and here as, erm, himself.</p>
<p>He loves open source so he keeps lots of things on GitHub like <a href="https://github.com/SteveBarnett/Contract">the contract he uses</a>, <a href="https://github.com/SteveBarnett/Client-Questionnaire">the questions he asks clients</a>, a <a href="https://github.com/SteveBarnett/Personas-Template">template for lightweight UX Personas</a>, <a href="https://github.com/SteveBarnett/Checklists">checklists for UX and accessibility</a>, <a href="https://github.com/SteveBarnett/Freelancer-Friday-Flections">retrospective templates</a>.</p>
<p>You can drop him a line at <a href="&#x6d;&#x61;&#x69;&#x6c;&#x74;&#x6f;&#x3a;&#x68;&#x65;&#x6c;&#x6c;&#x6f;&#x40;&#x6e;&#x61;&#x67;&#x61;&#x2e;&#x63;&#x6f;&#x2e;&#x7a;&#x61;&#x2e;">&#x68;&#x65;&#x6c;&#x6c;&#x6f;&#x40;&#x6e;&#x61;&#x67;&#x61;&#x2e;&#x63;&#x6f;&#x2e;&#x7a;&#x61;&#x2e;</a> Sometimes he writes things in the third person and it feels a bit odd ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.</p>
