<p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Steve Barnett.</p>
<p>I help software teams <strong>have happier customers</strong> and <strong>make better software</strong>. The best way to do this is by becoming <strong>more user-centered</strong>.</p>
<p>It provides your business with a competitive advantage: your site is faster and reaches more people. I design and build sites and apps that <strong>everyone can use, regardless of their device, the network they’re on, or any disabilities they might have</strong>. I do this by by designing and building in a future friendly way, and I can help your team do it too.</p>

<p>I do <strong>Front-end development and User Experience work</strong>. That means I’m somewhere between the worlds of back-end development and graphic design: I talk code stuff with the developers and I talk design stuff with the designers. The UX of side of things covers what should be built, and the FED side covers how it should be built.</p>
<h3 id="how-i-can-help">How I can help</h3>
<p>Becoming an excellent User-centered team doesn’t happen overnight. I help teams find and make the small changes that will make a big, lasting, impact to help them in  their journey. I help them level up with short, focused workshops, or by working directly with them on a project. I help them make a clear business case clear for spending more time on the Front-end and User Experience.</p>

<p>I also help teams set themselves up for making continuous improvements in future by picking up bits of work that they don’t have capacity for, then walking them through what I did, how I did it, and why I made the choices I did. I help back-end developers learn more about the front-end, help front-end developers learn more about UX, and help both to write better, faster, more widely supported code.</p>
<p>If I haven’t worked with you before, I usually like to do a small project first. This gives you a chance to see that you&rsquo;re happy with my work and check that we&rsquo;re a good fit for working together.</p>
