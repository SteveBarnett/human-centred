Accessibility is essential for some and useful for many. It's not about lowering stands, but removing barriers. Say yes to users as much as possible.

Remember that [Accessibility is about people](https://www.w3.org/WAI/people/). In particular, meeting the needs of disabled people in the real world, making sure that digital technology works for people with disabilities.
