- Know the [Rules of ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/using-aria/#NOTES). Use HTML if we can, and add any ARIA carefully.
- Have a handle on [ARIA attributes](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#state_prop_def). Know which ones we can get from the HTML, and which ones needs to be added.
- Check new ideas and patterns against the [ARIA Patterns](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/) for ideas for best practice.
