- It's good **for us.** It's more meaningful work, aligning with our human-centered values. It helps us make more concise solutions that more simple and robust. It requires more creativity to find good solutions. It's making the design vision work for a wide variety of people.
- It's good **for the business.** It gives us more customers (from can't use to can use for some people). It gives us happier customers (from good to great for some people). It helps us support user choice and preference. It gives us an edge over our competitors, and improves our brand perception and reputation. Itâ€™s a mark of high quality.
- It's good **for lowering legal risk.** Some countries have legal requirements for accessibility. Some countries have anti-discrimination laws which can lead to litigation. Being seen as a brand that doesn't care about inclusion, diversity, and accessibility is not a good look.
