- **People with disabilities aren't our target market.** They're only a small group of users anyway.
	- It's absurd to discriminate based on disability. We don't discriminate on other aspects of being a human.
	- They are in our target market. Accessibility improvements help more than just people with disabilities.
	- Disability is a spectrum, not a binary.A disability can be permanent, temporary, or contextual.
- **It’s difficult.** It takes too long. It’s easy to do ARIA wrong and make things worse. It's only realistic / practical / possible on small projects. We don't have support to do it.
	- It can be difficult at first, but it's part of continuous professional development (like many other skills). It gets easier with practice.
	- It can be done bit by bit. Small changes add up. It's mostly different work, not more work: making better choices earlier on.
- **It’s boring.** It’s not shiny or glamorous. It limits our creativity.
	- It's a chance to be innovative.
	- It’s part of high quality, professional, work.
	- It gives us more, happier, customers.
- **It's a quick fix.** We can quickly add accessibility things before the release. We can use an overlay. Automated tools are enough. It’s just about adding ARIA things to the code.
	- It works best when considered from the start. Finding and fixing issues at the end of the process is slow, frustrating, work. The earlier in the process we do it, the quicker and simpler it is.
	- Everyone has a part to play in making things more accessible.
- **It's ugly.** Accessible can't be beautiful.
	- Then we haven't found the right solution yet!
	- It does provide more constraints, but that's an opportunity for more creative solutions.
- **Other things are higher priority.**
