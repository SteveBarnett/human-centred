- Run the [aXe browser extension](https://www.deque.com/axe/). This is a good tool to run first since its philosophy of 'zero false positives' means the list of errors is usually short.
- Run the [ARC toolkit browser extension](https://www.paciellogroup.com/toolkit/) (Chrome only). This is a good tool to run next since it will flag more errors, and provides an easy way of inspecting the accessibility of semantic structures such as headings, landmarks, links, buttons, form controls, and alt text. In particular, check that:
    - link text describes the destination of the link;
    - button text describes the action that will happen;
    - alt text conveys the content and function of each image.
- Do the assessment option of the [Microsoft Accessibility Insights browser extension](https://accessibilityinsights.io/) (Chrome only). This is a good tool to use next because it offers good coverage of the WCAG SC (Success Criteria). It's a reasonably lengthy process, but gets faster with practice.
