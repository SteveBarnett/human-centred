### Giving feedback

- **Timely**. Give feedback as close to the event as possible, but choose the right time: when the person is likely to be receptive.
- **Behaviours**. Have specific examples of behaviours, not traits or emotions. It's possible to objectively observe behaviour. Mention the results of behaviours.
- **Actionable** and future-focused. Outline specific places for improvement and highlight successful behaviours and techniques. We can change the future, but we can't change the past.
- **Relevant**. Align the feedback with the goal / objective. What's the problem that's trying to be solved?

### Receiving feedback

- **Receive**. Provide context for the feedback you're asking for. Say what you want feedback on. Set expectations and boundaries. Explain what you're trying to achieve.
- **Reflect**. Ask clarifying questions. Take notes so you remember what was said and why.
- **Respond**. Decide if you want to act on the feedback. You don't have to decide immediately.

### Four types of feedback

- **Positive and expected**: Something we already know we do well.
- **Positive and unexpected**: Something we don't know we're doing well.
- **Negative and expected**: Something we already know we could improve.
- **Negative and unexpected**: Something we didn't know we could improve.
