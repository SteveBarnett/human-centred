## Giving feedback

- **Timely**. Give feedback as close to the event as possible, but choose the right time: when the person is likely to be receptive.
- **Behaviours**. Have specific, clear, examples of behaviours (which can be objectively observed), not traits or emotions.
- **Impact**. Describe the impact of behaviours. Keep it relevant by aligning the feedback with the goal / objective.
- **Request**. Make a specific actionable request (not a demand) for behaviour changes, or ask questions about current behaviour. Use positive language, highlight successful behaviours and techniques..

## Receiving feedback

- **Ready**. Provide context for the feedback you're asking for. Say what you want feedback on. Set expectations and boundaries. Explain what you're trying to achieve.
- **Receive**. Listen closely. Don't analyse or judge, don't make assumptions.
- **Reflect**. Ask clarifying questions. Take notes so you remember what was said and why.
- **Respond**. Decide if you want to act on the feedback. You don't have to decide immediately.

## Praise and criticism

- Praise
  - in public;
  - specific and sincere;
  - include a challenge.
- Criticism
  - in private;
  - kind (long-term best, not short-term easiest) and clear;
  - humble, helpful, in person.

## Four types of feedback

- **Positive and expected**: Something we already know we do well.
- **Positive and unexpected**: Something we don't know we're doing well.
- **Negative and expected**: Something we already know we could improve.
- **Negative and unexpected**: Something we didn't know we could improve.

## Feedback with the most emotional power

- A domain we care about
- An are we feel uncertain about
