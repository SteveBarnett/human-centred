layout: sounds-like
title: Button with just an icon in it, aria-labelledby
sounds-like: Add a question, Button
comment: If there's visible text, we prefer to use that for accessible names. Note how aria-labelledby overrides both the aria-label and the text of the button. It's better to have the text in the button.
