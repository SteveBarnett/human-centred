- **A shared responsibility**{: #a-shared-responsiblity }
  - Understand that complex, systemic, changes are needed for the big problems. They tend to be from multiple, large scale, long-term, structural causes (rather than individual bad actors).
  - Focus outward, on future actions (rather than (only) inwards, on past blame and guilt)
  - Promote helpful co-operation (rather getting squirming defensiveness from blaming)
- **Nudging**{: #nudging }
  - Use anchoring.
  - Use loss aversion.
  - Use availability bias.
  - Use mere measurement effect (ask, for details).
  - Positive Injunctive > Negative Informational.
- **Emotional**{: #emotional }
  - Use an emotional argument. Entertain and excite to overcome indifference, disinterest, apathy.
  - Use human-scale stats or vivid details. Show a big, emotional, display of the problem. Bring reality into the room.
  - Show before and after to motivate the change.
- **Empathetic**{: #empathetic }
  - Understand why the change is difficult and frustrating. It takes time and needs supports.
  - Understand both sides. The pros and cons.
  - Make the change sufficiently alluring.
- **Questioning**{: #questioning }
  - Ask questions rather than give answers. Provide a curiosity gap.
  - Let people draw their own conclusions, discover the answers themselves.
  - Promote a growth mindset, not a fixed mindset.
- **Identity-based**{: #identity }
  - Connect to the past and the familiar, things and truths they already know.
  - Highlight the values and beliefs that make it important, since they guide behaviour.
  - Find things that are widely relevant, not locally specific.
- **Looped**{: #looped }
  - Frame changes as experiments (that are safe to fail).
  - Focus on effort and progress (not ability or setbacks)
  - → (Re)trial → Feedback → Reflection ↵
  - Use Spaced Retrieval to make it stick
- **Relevant**{: #relevant }
  - Put the why before the what.
  - Have clear, meaningful, relevant, goals.
  - Have outcomes-based actions with observable impact.
- **Tilted**{: #titled }
  - Ask who to exclude to get a bigger circle of inclusion.
  - When comparing, put the other first.
