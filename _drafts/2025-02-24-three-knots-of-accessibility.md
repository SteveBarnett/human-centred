There are three assumptions that we sometimes make that can tie us up in knots about accessibility.

Flipping them, we get three "not"s (instead on knots) that help us think more broadly, in a more human-centred way. More broadly like: be less sure, explore more, ask more question. Adopt a beginner's mind, and assume that we have lots of learn.

We live in an ableist society. Looking at these "not"s helps us understand

- the wide range of human experience
- that abilities exist on a spectrum
- that things seldom go as planned.

When I say "We sometimes assume" in the following, I mean "we" as in our ableist society.

## 1. Not-separate

We sometimes assume that "people" and "disabled people" are separate groups.

This is not quite true. There are distinctions and differences, but the boundary lines we draw are made up. These boundaries can have short-term, problem-remediation, utility in products and services. But they're not a true representation of how the world is. Most things exist on a spectrum, not as a binary. And the closer we look at any given boundary, the more we see, and the fuzzier the distinction becomes.

If a Quality Engineer who knows nothing about accessibility does manual testing with a keyboard, is that just "testing"? If an Accessibility Specialist does the same manual testing with a keyboard, is that now "Accessibility testing"?

When we look at our product or service's user journeys, we can see that there are just common, core, human, tasks that our users are doing.

- Shopping, not Disabled Shopping
- Banking, not Disabled Banking
- Emailing, not Disabled Emailing

Our customers are task-focused, self-centred.

## 2. Not-same

We sometimes assume that disabled people as a category are all the same. We make this assumption more frequently for sub-categories, such as: all blind people are the same.

This is not true. Not all members of a group are the same. We can see this clearly when we look at other categories we use frequently.

- Are all humans the same? Are all Europeans the same? Are all Italians the same? Are all Venetians the same? Are the people in one household the same?
- Are all humans the same? Are all tall people the same?

It's a normal human tendency to make categories. It's how our brains handle having too much information to deal with. But when the categories are misapplied or mistakenly understood as truth, it causes trouble and we make mistakes. 

Some ways to address this, inspired by the Generalisation chapter of [Factfulness by Hans Rosling](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34890015-factfulness).

- Look for differences within groups. The larger the group, the more differences we can find.
- Look for differences between groups too. 
- Beware of exceptional examples.

- gain first-hand experience of cultures as they actually exist, rather than the way they are portrayed in the press.
The Social Model:<br>Ability + Barrier = Disability

Disability is not a binary, not a `true`/`false`.

## 3. Not-singular (and/or not-static)

We sometimes assume that a disabled people has just one disability.

- Many people have more than one disability. Disabilities interact with each other that make them more complex than the single disabilities on their own.
- Age brings changes in ability, usually resulting in multiple disabilities for people.

## Aside: why can't it both?

Practical, how-to, instructions? Or emotional, philosophical, motivational ideas? Yes! We need both to start doing and keep doing accessibility work. The ideological underpinning is more important, though. 

Focusing too much on the practical side of things without the philosophical side makes it easier to give up, or to get lost, or to do the wrong thing. 

Focusing more on the philosophical side, having [good motivations](https://naga.co.za/more-accessible-products/#offer-good-motivations), allows us to be more flexible when we do the practical side. We can put our energy where it feels best, where weâ€™re most interested, where we can make the most impact.

## Conclusion

Remembering the three nots can help us not get tied up in knots.

- Not-separate
- Not-same
- Not-singular

Achieving identical experiences for everyone is impossible. But equivalent experiences is very possible!
