I like simplicity. The simplest possible version(s) of things. Finding the MVP of an idea to test it first.

[The Rule Of Least Power](https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/leastPower) suggests choosing the least powerful language suitable for a given purpose. I think this is a great idea!

### Why use low power stuff?

- Power and flexibility and inversely related. More power means harder to analyse.
- Ease of analysis, of seeing the end result and understanding how it came about.

### Why use old stuff?

- Using something for longer lets you get to know it's quirks, pain points.
- Old tech's capabilities and failure modes are well understood. It has more known unknowns and fewer unknown unknowns.
- Reusing old tech has a lower costs to teams, to a company, that adding new tech.
- Using older tech usually means we're spending more time solving business problems (being user-centered), and less time solving tech problems (being dev- or self-centered)?

### Ooh, shiny!

- Developers like exciting / cool / latest.
    - Sometimes we neglect to recognise the cons, though, focusing too much on the pros.
- People like exciting / cool / latest.
- In the longer term, users prefer reliable / stable / trustworthy to exciting / cool / latest.

### How I like to do things

- â€œCan we solve this using old / our existing tech?" Be clear on problems with old stack.
- Sometimes new tech is the right choice. But use new tech carefully, slowly.
  - choose tools where the positives outweigh the negatives. Not just "any benefit".
- Do as little as possible. Choose simplicity, elegance, and commonality first.
  - Embrace the constraints and limitations of the browser, and get a wider reach as a result.
