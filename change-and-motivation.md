## A, B, C

- **Asking:** the statement or action you're asking for.
- **Becausing:** the data and facts that explain why.
- **Convincing:** the response to anticipated challenges.

## Motivate change

- Direct the Rider
  - Follow the bright spots
  - Have a destination postcard
  - Script the critical steps
- Motivate the Elephant
  - Find the feeling
  - Shrink the change
  - Promote a growth mindset
- Shape the Path
  - Tweak the environment
  - Rally the herd
  - Make it a habit

Careful of the Fundamental Attribution Error: maybe it's the situation and not the person.

## Three realms of disagreement

Things to check:
