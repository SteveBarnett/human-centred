## A, B, C

- **Asking:** the statement or action you're asking for.
- **Becausing:** the data and facts that explain why.
- **Convincing:** the response to anticipated challenges.

## Motivate change

- Direct the Rider
  - Follow the bright spots
  - Have a destination postcard
  - Script the critical steps
- Motivate the Elephant
  - Find the feeling
  - Shrink the change
  - Promote a growth mindset
- Shape the Path
  - Tweak the environment
  - Rally the herd
  - Make it a habit

Careful of the Fundamental Attribution Error: maybe it's the situation and not the person.

## Three realms of disagreement

- What is true?
- What is meaningful?
- What is useful?

Things to check:

- Is everyone arguing in the same realm?
- Is it actually about urgency, priority, grieving, solidarity?

## Disagreement Template

- Learn
  - Facts and evidence
  - (Multiple, diverse) Interpretations
  - (Multiple) Values
- Orient
  - Shared values
  - Proposal
  - Discussion
- Act
  - Commit
  - Check-in tripwire
  - Measurement of success

## Hierarchy for motivating change

{% include hierarchy-for-motivating-change.md %}

## Planning the change

- Attractive
  - Link a reward with a good action
- Satisfying
  - Use a habit tracker, visual record of progress
- Easy
  - Start with small, quick, wins
- Obvious
  - Use Implementation Intentions, tweak the environment

## Behaviour change model: BMAP

- Behaviour = Motivation &times; Ability &times; Prompt
  - Sufficient Motivation and Ability are required to cross "The Action Line"
  - Motivation and Ability can compensate for each other somewhat
- Troubleshooting order
  - Is there a Prompt? (Action prompts are more reliable than Person or Context Prompts)
  - Is there an Ability blocker? (Make the Behaviour easier. Check time, money, physical effort, mental effort, routine)
  - Is there enough Motivation? (It's unreliable. Motivation towards an abstract doesn't work.)
- Celebrate immediately after the habit because emotions form habits via dopamine
- Rehearse a habit to make it sink in more quickly.

## Coach-like questions

Some coach-like questions for clarification and getting to the root cause. An alternative to using Five Whys because that can be annoying sometimes.

The focus is a bit like Appreciative Inquiry: focus on strengths and assets rather than problems and deficits.

- What do you mean?
- What do you want?
- What's worked before?
- And what else?
- How can I help?

Watch for SCARF: status, certainty, autonomy, relatedness (social), fairness.

## PACT goals

A different take on SMART goals.

- **Purposeful**. Meaningful to your long-term purpose in life.
- **Actionable**. Based on outputs you can control, an adaptable approach.
- **Continuous**. Simple, repeatable, actions, an adaptable approach.
- **Trackable**. Rather than measurable, a "yes"/"no".
