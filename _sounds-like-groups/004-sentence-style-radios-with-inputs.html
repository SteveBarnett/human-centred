title: Radios with sentence style contents and form controls in them
sounds-like: Recurring options group, Repeat frequency, radio button, not checked. [tab] Recurring options group, Number, 1, combo box.
comment: The radios are choices in a group so (they share a name attribute and) we wrap them all in one fieldset. Since we're using a fieldset we add a legend, but visually hide it. The contents of each radio is too complex to be a label so we use aria-label instead. In this example we don't want to show labels for the selects, so we use aria-label there too (a visually hidden label would also work). Some non-relevant attributes in the code are omitted for brevity.
