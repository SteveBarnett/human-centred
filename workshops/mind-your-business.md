# None of our business

Someone's disability or Assistive Technology is none of our business.

# For example

- **Me:** regular flat white, please.
- **Barista:** where are you on the spectrum?

# Who does it matter to?

- Our customers just want to Do The Thing.
- Why is it important to us?
    - Is that really a good reason?
    - We may want to use it "for good." But what might a bad actor do with it?
