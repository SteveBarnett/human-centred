- Not "those disabled people over there" but "us humans right here."
- When we choose to draw a line between disabled people and not-disabled people, the line will be in the wrong place.

# Where's the line between a11y testing and regular testing?

- For example: keyboard testing.
- Who uses the keyboard?
- How do we know if they're disabled or not?
- What if they don't identify as disabled?
- This distinction is constructed! But it can be useful sometimes.

# It's part of, not separate from, pt2

- Separate stories and Acceptance Criteria for a11y are okay as a short-term remediation thing
- The goal is to get to a place where it's part of day-to-day work
    - Does a blind screen reader user think "I'm going to do some accessible banking!" or just "I'm going to do some banking".
    - The core human need, the task. It's actually none of our business how they do it!

# It's part of, not separate from, pt3

- Our UIs have a "level of accessibility" whether we think about it or not
