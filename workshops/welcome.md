# Shouting time üôã

Let's play a (very) brief game of<br>"How many people?"

[.background-color: #104]

---

# How many people...

- are there on Earth?
- About 8 billion.

[. build-lists: true]
[.background-color: #326]

---

# How many people...

- in the world have disabilities?
- About **1 billion** people...
- ... have (at least one) disability.
- (It's about 15%, so technically 1.2b)

[. build-lists: true]
[.background-color: #548]

^ And that's mostly "official" disabilities, and people how identify as disabled. We'll come back to that in a second.

---

# How many people...

- are there in Aotearoa New Zealand?
- About 5 million.

[. build-lists: true]
[.background-color: #326]

---

# How many people...

- in Aotearoa New Zealand have disabilities?
- About 1 million people...
-  have (at least one) disability.
- (It's about actually 25%, so more like 1.25m)
- (And 53% had more than one)

^ Again, it depends how you count.
^ 2013 figure, 53% had more than one

[. build-lists: true]
[.background-color: #548]

# Something to remember

- "Permanent disability" numbers
- "Identify as disabled" numbers

# **(Gentle!) activity**
## A human uses the Web

[.background-color: #326]

---

A human
using a **mouse** and **Safari** on **Mac**
uses the Web

üëÜ
What might change?
How do we customise these things?

[.background-color: #548]

---

A human
using a **mouse / trackpad / keyboard / switch control / puffer / magnification tool / voice control / screen reader** and **Safari / Chrome / Firefox / Edge** on **Windows / Mac / Linux desktop / laptop / tablet / phone** in **light / dark mode / high contrast mode** with **reduced motion** with **smaller / larger text**
uses the Web

[.background-color: #104]

---

Humans (including us!) interact with our product in a very wide range of ways

[.background-color: #326]

# The Social Model üöß

- **Useful** model, to help us think more broadly
- Not the only one, or "the best"

[.background-color: #104]

---

# Some types of disability

- Auditory
- Cognitive
- Physical
- Visual

<br><br>A useful list, not the only one, or "the best".

[.background-color: #215]

---

# Social model of disability

- **Disability = Ability + Barrier**
- A **Disability** occurs when a person's **Ability** comes into contact with a **Barrier** in the environment or product.
- Mismatched interactions can create barriers to access for many people.

[.background-color: #326]

# (Gentle) activity time! üôã

Let's think about the **visual** category under the social model of disability

[.background-color: #304]

---

Raise your hand or nod your head if you or someone you know is: **blind**

[.background-color: #526]

---

# Potential barrier üöß

No text alternatives for non-text content

[.background-color: #726]

---

Raise your hand or nod your head if you or someone you know has: **low vision or poor eyesight**, **(perhaps from old age)**

[.background-color: #526]

---

# Potential barrier üöß

No (or poor) responsive styles

[.background-color: #726]

---

Raise your hand or nod your head if you or someone you know is: **colour blind**

[.background-color: #526]

---

# Potential barrier üöß

Using only colour to convey information

[.background-color: #726]

---

Raise your hand or nod your head if you or someone you know has: **been outside on a sunny day**, **with a shiny screen**

[.background-color: #526]

---

# Potential barrier üöß

Low colour contrast between text and the background

For example: captions!

# Progress over prefection

> ‚ÄúIt doesn't have to be perfect, just a little bit better than yesterday"
-- L√©onie Watson<br>(member of W3C Advisory Board,<br>founder of [TetraLogical](https://tetralogical.com/about/), and more)

---

# This is the root of it.

- Not "those disabled people over there" but "us humans right here."
- When we choose to draw a line between disabled people and not-disabled people, the line will be in the wrong place.

---

# Testers, not everyday users

- Don't need to be, or pretend to be, an everyday user to test well, to find many of the biggest barriers that everyday user will encounter.
    - Of course it's not the same. Of course we won't find all the barriers.

---

# What we're doing today

- We can't cover everything today, but we can get started, grab a map and a compass and note a few trails.

---

# Word of warning

- Be wary of people who talk in binaries, extremes, absolutes.
    - The truth is generally more complicated (and interesting!) than that.
    - There's no such thing as 100% accessible. Because (we are) humans!
        - But we can make it much better, and keep making it better.
    - 100% compliant to WCAG is tricky and doesn't necessarily mean good usability.

---

# Growth mindset, mistakes

- Growth Mindset.
    - It can be uncomfortable. That's the feeling of brain cells growing! (Sort of)
    - Mistakes are expected. It's what you do next that counts.
        - I am bound to make some mistakes today, please feel free to point them out!
        - But, you know, don't be a jerk about it.

---

# Where's the line between a11y testing and regular testing?

- For example: keyboard testing.
- Who uses the keyboard?
- How do we know if they're disabled or not?
- What if they don't identify as disabled?
- This distinction is constructed! But it can be useful sometimes.

---

# It's part of, not separate from

- Accessibility is part of Quality. Part of functionality. Part of Usability.
- Connect to Quality, Security, Privacy

---

# It's part of, not separate from, pt2

- Separate stories and Acceptance Criteria for a11y are okay as a short-term remediation thing
- The goal is to get to a place where it's part of day-to-day work
    - Does a blind screen reader user think "I'm going to do some accessible banking!" or just "I'm going to do some banking".
    - The core human need, the task. It's actually none of our business how they do it!

---

# It's part of, not separate from, pt3

- Our UIs have a "level of accessibility" whether we think about it or not
