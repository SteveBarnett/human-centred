Something to know about before you start: [The accessibility tree](/2022/06/08/the-accessibility-tree/).

## Start here

Three(ish) lists, they're all good! The rest of this page is my recommendation for breaking down the first one.

1. [Accessibility audit process](/2024/06/16/accessibility-audit-process/)
    - [Accessibility audit process for mobile](/2022/05/31/accessibility-audit-process-mobile/)
2. [Accessibility Not-Checklist ](https://not-checklist.intopia.digital/)
3. [Checklist - The A11y Project](https://www.a11yproject.com/checklist/)

- For understanding seriousness of issues: [Accessibility Audit Severity examples](/2022/12/06/accessibility-audit-severity-examples/).
- For writing up results: [Accessibility Audit Guide: writing good words](/2023/01/13/accessibility-audit-guide-writing-good-words/).

## Quick accessibility (a11y) checks

A bit of framing/thinking: [Efficient accessibility testing](/2023/08/10/efficient-accessibility-testing/).

Overview and high-level version, good for just doing the testing:

- [Quick A11y Checks (QAC! ü¶Ü)](/2021/12/13/qac/) (Keyboard, Headings, axe DevTools)
- [Quick Accessibility Checks (QAC! üê•) for mobile](/2023/01/09/qac-for-mobile/) (Larger text, Greyscale, Scanner)

Some other quick versions.

- [Easy Checks ‚Äì A First Review of Web Accessibility ‚Äì WAI](https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/preliminary/)
- [Form design: from zero to hero all in one blog post](https://adamsilver.io/blog/form-design-from-zero-to-hero-all-in-one-blog-post/#form-validation)

## QAC in detail

More detailed version, good for understanding the why and the how and the nuances: 

- [Duck Tales Episode 1: Keyboard](/2023/08/23/duck-tales-episode1-keyboard/)
- [Duck Tales Episode 2: Headings](/2023/08/23/duck-tales-episode2-headings/)

## Manual and automated testing, tool-assisted and experiential testing

Go to [Projects that use axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core/blob/develop/doc/projects.md#projects-that-use-axe-core) and (hopefully!) find axe for your setup. Prefer end-to-end flavours to unit flavours: axe is best at testing a whole page, as it appears to the user.

Have a read through of [the config options](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core/blob/develop/doc/API.md#api-name-axeconfigure). It can handy to tweak these in the beginning, before running the default set eventually. For example: (temporarily!) including or excluding particular elements, or (temporarily!) excluding certain rules.
