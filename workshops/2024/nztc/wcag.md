# WCAG ðŸ¤“

- Perhaps you've noticed it's been several hours and this is the first time I'm mentioning WCAG.
- That (hopefully) tells you something about where it sits in terms of importance and priority.

# WCAG: structure

- Organised into four Principles: **P**erceivable, **O**perable, **U**nderstandable, **R**obust
- Each Principle is split into Guidelines.
- Each Guideline is split into Success Criteria.
    - Sort of like Acceptance Criteria.

# WCAG âœ”

- Careful of checklist-thinking! ([not-checklist](https://not-checklist.intopia.digital/))
- Standards set the minimum.
    - As in: less than this is actively bad.
    - As in: more than this is probably good.
    - The standards have some gaps, loopholes.
    - We choose the maximum.

# Not-WCAG: Severity

- Something WCAG sort-of doesn't have now, but will sort-of later: severity.
- Issue Severity: Critical, High, Medium, Low.
