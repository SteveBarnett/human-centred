# WCAG ðŸ¤“

^ - Perhaps you've noticed it's been several hours and this is the first time I'm mentioning WCAG.
- That (hopefully) tells you something about where it sits in terms of importance and priority.

<!-- # Principles -->

# Perceivable
# Operable
# Understandable
# Robust

^ - Organised into four Principles: **P**erceivable, **O**perable, **U**nderstandable, **R**obust
- Each Principle is split into Guidelines.
- Each Guideline is split into Success Criteria.
    - Sort of like Acceptance Criteria.

# Success Criteria

<!-- - SCs help docs: -->
<!-- ## Sufficient (one way) -->
<!-- ## Advisory (an idea) -->
<!-- ## Failure (how about no) -->

## Levels A, AA, AAA

<!-- # Not a checklist -->

<!-- - Careful of checklist-thinking! -->
# [fit] Standards set the minimum.<br>We choose the maximum.

^ - As in: less than this is actively bad.
- As in: more than this is probably good.
- The standards have some gaps, loopholes.

# Severity<br><br>

<!-- - Something WCAG sort-of doesn't have now, but will sort-of later: severity. -->

# Critical, High, Medium, Low.
