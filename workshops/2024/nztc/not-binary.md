# Disability is a spectrum, not a binary

---

When we look at disability as a spectrum instead of a binary, we can see that a lot more people struggle to use our stuff than we might think. The good news is that making things accessible helps even more people than we might realise. In the best case we take something from can’t use to can use. In the worst case, we make something a little easier for everyone to use. That means more, happier, humans using our stuff. Yay!

---

Maybe we think of a person either having or not having a disability. Like a switch that can be turned on or off.

A toggle switch labelled Has disability?

That seems to make sense at first glance. But hang on, let’s clarify: what do we mean by disability?

---

Toggle switches for auditory, cognitive, physical, visual

That seems better. It’s a bit more like the real world. There are many types of disability. And now it helps us see that someone might have more than one disability at a time. Something’s still not quite right, though.

---

Someone’s functional capability could be affected by a wide range of things.

Who do you know that matches one of the descriptions in the boxes? A friend, a parent, a colleague, yourself?

All sorts of people, with all sorts of abilities. Maybe our three on / off switches aren’t quite the right way of looking at it either.

---

Now for the tricky bit. What’s something between those two? It might be near one end or the other, but it’s different from either. If you can’t think of something near the “on” switch, try thinking about something near the “off” switch.

Maybe disability is in fact a spectrum and not a binary!

Cognitive, Physical, and Visual disabilities each represented as a slider, rather than as toggle switches
