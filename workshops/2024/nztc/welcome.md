Think more broadly,
in a more human-centred way.

^ This helps us understand the wide range of human experience, that abilities exist on a spectrum, and that things seldom go as planned.

# Acknowledge and embrace human diversity

- Other people are the same as you.
- Other people are different to you.

^ Unless you're here with your twin or your clone, you may notice that the other people in the room are **different** to you. Of course, you immediately notice similarities, because humans brains are (among other things) pattern recognition machines. But the more attention you pay, the more you zoom in on the details, the more differences you notice.

# Consider what's between the human and the UI
  
- Think about input methods, browser, operating system, screen size and resolution, user preferences and choices, network connection (cost, speed, latency), age and condition of hardware, age of the person, experience level, assistive technology.
- Think about options and preferences, not accessibility options.

#  Go off The Happy Path
  
Consider what’s messy, fragile, unpredictable. We already know that sometimes people will encounter problems with our products. That’s why we have error states and messages. We just need to widen this lens.

# Testers, not everyday users

- Don't need to be, or pretend to be, an everyday user to test well, to find many of the biggest barriers that everyday user will encounter.
    - Of course it's not the same. Of course we won't find all the barriers.

---

# What we're doing today

- We can't cover everything today, but we can get started, grab a map and a compass and note a few trails.

---

# Word of warning

- Be wary of people who talk in binaries, extremes, absolutes.
    - The truth is generally more complicated (and interesting!) than that.
    - There's no such thing as 100% accessible. Because (we are) humans!
        - But we can make it much better, and keep making it better.
    - 100% compliant to WCAG is tricky and doesn't necessarily mean good usability.

---

# Growth mindset, mistakes

- Growth Mindset.
    - It can be uncomfortable. That's the feeling of brain cells growing! (Sort of)
    - Mistakes are expected. It's what you do next that counts.
        - I am bound to make some mistakes today, please feel free to point them out!
        - But, you know, don't be a jerk about it.
