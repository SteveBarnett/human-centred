# [fit] 💡 The big idea 💡<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Think more broadly,<br>in a more human-centred way.

^ Or: be less sure. Or: think more exploratorily.
^ Or: beginner's mind. Maybe I have some interesting things to learn.
^ We live in an ableist society.
^ This helps us understand the wide range of human experience, that abilities exist on a spectrum, and that things seldom go as planned.

# 1. Not-separate


^ - The boundaries we draw are made up.
- "Testing" vs "Accessibility testing", e.g. keyboard.
- Boundaries can have short-term (remediation) utility, though.

# Common, core, human, tasks

^ - Shopping, not Disabled Shopping
- Banking, not Disabled Banking
- Emailing, not Disabled Emailing

^ Our clients are task-focused, self-centred.

# 3. Not-singular<br>(also: not-static)

^ Many people have more than one disability.
Age brings changes in ability.
