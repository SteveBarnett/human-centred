# [fit] 💡 The big idea 💡<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Think more broadly,<br>in a more human-centred way.

^ Or: be less sure. Or: think more exploratorily.
^ Or: beginner's mind. Maybe I have some interesting things to learn.
^ This helps us understand the wide range of human experience, that abilities exist on a spectrum, and that things seldom go as planned.

# 1. Not-separate


^ - The boundaries we draw are made up.
- "Testing" vs "Accessibility testing", e.g. keyboard.
- Boundaries can have short-term (remediation) utility, though.

# Common, core, human, tasks

^ - Shopping, not Disabled Shopping
- Banking, not Disabled Banking
- Emailing, not Disabled Emailing

^ Our clients are task-focused, self-centred.

## "Accessibility: Essential for some, useful for all."

### [fit] - The Web Accessibility Initiative

^ For example: captions!

# 2. Not-strict

^ The edges are fuzzy

[.background-color: #206]

# The Social Model:<br>Ability + Barrier = Disability

[.background-color: #428]

---

# [fit] Disability is not a binary,<br>not a `true`/`false`.

[.background-color: #64a]

---

<!-- # Some categories of disability -->

# Auditory
# Cognitive
# Physical
# Visual

[.background-color: #64a]

---

# 3. Not-singular<br>(also: not-static)

^ Many people have more than one disability.
Age brings changes in ability.

<!-- # Same same but different -->

# [fit] Achieving identical experiences<br>for everyone is impossible.<br><br><br><br><br>But equivalent experiences<br>is very possible!
