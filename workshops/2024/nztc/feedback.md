## What worked well? üëç

- Hands-on experience, lots of well structured memorable content, lots of thinking pieces that I will definitely come back to. Also Thanks for all the insights, Steve! The food was amazing, too.
- Speaker is very knowledgeable. Example activities such as the Hocus Focus gave tangible experience on poor accessibility website. Gained a wider perspective on the topic from zero knowledge to intermediate skill level. Resources provided are very handy and good thoroughness.
- The voices used for the announcements
- The cadence of the workshop
- The approachability of the humans running the workshop to various tangentially related questions
- I enjoyed it the most when Steve was demo-ing something specific, such as showing how Voiceover works on screen, or specific explanations on why we should have certain attributes (e.g: no language set on the site). It was also good to explore some of the tools ourselves like Voiceover or inspecting with axe DevTools. 
- I also liked the Hocus :focus activity, which served as a useful introduction and we went into deeper discussion into what tab indexes are, and values for them. I wish we had more of these type of activities. 
- I liked that Steve was around to answer questions if we had any‚ÄîI found the most practical value out of listening to the discussions between Steve and Prae about encountering these testing issues or common issues with specific components (e.g: placeholder text) in real-life. "
- Really interesting content, learnt a lot of new perspectives to testing that I haven't before. Good structure, didn't feel to rushed or slow. 
- Good balance of theory and practice. Got plenty of opportunity to test things that we learnt. 
- Good facilitators, very informed and happy to answer any questions in a comprehensive manner.
- The resources provided were really useful, the audit process breakdown was particularly good as it included links to tools that would streamline some of the checks. Steve as a speaker felt approachable and genuine so it was easy to ask questions.
- Loads of useful information. Many chances to ask questions specific to our projects/work items. Lots of industry knowledge from the presenters. Gave us a point of reference for 'source of truth'/ what best practice looks like. Having the useful links and content to refer to later will be an asset.
- Really like that there were heaps of awesome resources to go through. I'll definitely be using these again, and sharing them with my team. 
- Steve spoke well and explained things in a great way that was easy to grasp. It's clear that he is very passionate about this topic.
- Nice venue, catering was great (thank you Fai!).
- Steve and Prae moving around the room to help people out worked well. 
- I have been using the ChromeVox extension as my screenreader, and Lighthouse to perform audits - great to know there are other, richer tools out there!"
- Casual, great venue and set up, Steve is veeeerrry knowledgeable and personable, presents information in a very easy to understand way. I enjoy the informal humourous presentation style :)
- "Fantastic content, learned lots.
- Good advice on how to get buy in from a company to improve accessibility.
Helpful links/resources."

## What could we change? Œî

- Not quite a change, more of a suggestion: I was wondering if we could have savoury GF/DF snack too? 
- Maybe instead of using a random website that I recently worked on, it might help to give specific websites that showcase certain example or activity checking that highlights the importance of accessibility testing. This approach can better help the participant relate to the experience that the speaker wants to convey. Demos on the finished implementation of accessibility testing tools in https://naga.co.za/2023/06/22/accessible-engineering-scorecard/#-we-test-accessibly can be enriching as well to inspire what good engineering practice looks like.
- The start time on the tickets
- The labelling on the urns (hot water / coffee should be on the table next to the tap too)
- The labelling on the milk (why is cows milk called 'regular' milk?)
- The labelling / signposting of the different resource pages is quite dense / hard to follow
- I also didn't get an email to join Discord beforehand so I was a bit lost at the beginning trying to sign up to Discord‚ÄîI had to verify everything and that definitely distracted me from the initial activity of getting axe DevTools installed. 
- I felt that there were heaps of pages that all linked to each other so I would often get lost when Steve asked us to refer to a particular page or activity. All the pages look the same at first glance as they're full of text, so it was difficult to tell what page he was referring to without any visual reference. 
- I felt that we were left a bit too much time exploring on our own time, I would've loved to hear more from Steve about his testing process and what he does when he encounters accessibility issues. "
- Have more clear and specific activities throughout the day as opposed to just going through the list and leaving it up to us. 
- It would be good to see some examples demonstrated highlighting good and bad practices for different steps of the audit process tasks and a basic rundown of the extensions recommended / potentially overlooked features. There was a fountain downstairs but it would be nice to have water offered alongside the tea and coffee in the room.
- The email with the discord/jest links didn't seem to arrive prior to the course. This meant that the first part was spent floundering, trying to decipher where to find information/content of the course. The content format inside of https://naga.co.za/ contains links within links within links which is difficult to navigate or re-find information (although the content is valuable).
- I think that while it was a workshop, there could have been more of Steve presenting. 
- It was good to have the list of activities to try out, but I feel like these activities could be done by anyone in their own time away from a workshop format. Maybe it could be more collaborative, or some more presenting about different types of accessibility. It felt a bit _too_ self driven for my liking, and I found myself thinking ""now what"", after I'd gone through a bunch of the activities.
- More demos of examples done by Steve would have been awesome, an example of him doing an audit in action, or examples of webpages that have gotten a11y really wrong, demoing on web or mobile. Maybe some anecdotes, and real examples of things he's experienced in his testing.
- I've read that a11y isn't just about navigating through a webpage, it's also about the language and colour contrast (know there are a few tools out there that you can use to audit for contrast specifically). I think going through this stuff in the second half of the day would have been beneficial and changed things up a bit.
- Prior to the session I seemed to get missed off the list for the Discord channel, so felt a bit rushed getting things set up. I think Steve could have taken a bit of time at the beginning to make sure everyone had access to the links we'd be going through (since those were on the Discord too, and the slide changed before I could enter the link into my browser)."
- I reckon  more live demos of things. Maybe it would be cool to have Steve go through a website and do some a11y checks live, thinking out loud as he does so. Then the attendees (students?? 'People who showed up'??) could all go through the same web page and see what else they could uncover to share with the group. Game-ify it a bit. Use a deliberately a11y-poor page so that there's lots of teachable moments etc.
- Deeper walkthrough on using screen reader, it's surprisingly complicated.
- Maybe captions on separate screen from slides would help visibility?

## Anything else? ‚ò∫Ô∏è

- It was lovely to be able to put a face to the names I've only seen on Linkedin/emails/Summer of tech! A pleasure to meet you all.
- Overall, as a designer, I think this was a good introduction to accessibility testing (eventhough I did get lost on some of the terminology in axe DevTools). I love that we were given a list of useful resources that we can go away and look at in our own time.
- I did wish there was some more structured guidance on specific situations. I wonder if it would be good for Steve to share a list of common accessibility issues we could look out for‚Äîfor example, I overheard him talking about images and svgs, but it was a smaller discussion at another table‚Äîmaybe this could be part of the workshop content? Or if Steve went through a demo of a good example vs a bad example of an actual live site, and we could all learn and ask questions from it. "
- I found the workshop very valuable, improved my confidence in what we are doing well, where we might improve (also in terms of processes), and I have many things to take-away for actioning. Thank you to all involved, and thank you Steve. Your humour is appreciated (even though we often sat there like stunned mullets ;) )
- It's amazing to see the Testing community get reinvigorated again after a long hiatus. 
- A follow up session for this topic would be epic - maybe more around coding for a11y (my workplace gives me the freedom to make any code changes)
- All in all a very good maiden voyage for a11y conference. Heeeeaps of material for me to comb through, mull over, and relay back to my work place in implement into our ways of working. Thank you all so much team!! =))
- Nice food!
