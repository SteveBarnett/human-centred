## Warm-up email

Hello there. Thank you for signing up for the Accessibility testing workshop. You rock!

To help get you ready, we've got a little warm-up exercise for you 💪. Pick one (or more!) of the following questions to answer before the workshop. We'll be sharing and discussing our answers in the first session.

- What do you already know about accessibility?
- What do you already know about accessibility testing?
- What do you want to get out of the workshop?

**Important!** Remember to bring: your laptop, headphones, what you're working on right now (or as close to it as you can. This will make the workshop more relevant, which means more useful and more memorable 🤓). 

Regards,

Steve (the facilitator) and the NZTestingConf team

## Feedback form

### Blurb

Near the end of the day, we've scheduled 10 minutes of workshop time to fill in a feedback form. This is important to us for making things better each time. It's three open questions, in a slightly classic style: what was good, what was bad, what else?

### The form

> We'd really appreciate your help making things better. Content, logistics, lunch, any topic you have some feedback on will be helpful!
> All questions are optional. Your responses are anonymous by default, but you're welcome to add your name and/or email address.

- What was great? 👍
- What could we change? Δ
- Anything else? ☺️
- Your name 📛
- Your email address 📧
