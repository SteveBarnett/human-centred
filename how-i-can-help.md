title: How I can help
---

Becoming an excellent user-centered team doesn’t happen overnight. Old habits die hard and figuring out what users need (rather than what they say they want) is tricky. I help teams find and make the small changes that will make a big, lasting, impact to help them in their journey. Things I do:

- run short, focused, workshops on areas of FED or UX;
- work directly with teams on a project;
- make first version of UX deliverables with teams (like Personas and Journey Maps);
- help make a clear business case for spending more time on the front-end and user experience.

I also help teams set themselves up for making continuous improvements in future by picking up bits of work that they don’t have capacity for, then walking them through what I did, how I did it, and why I made the choices I did. I help back-end developers learn more about the front-end, help front-end developers learn more about UX, and help both to write better, faster, more widely supported code.

### What next?

If I haven’t worked with you before, I usually like to do a small project first. This gives you a chance to see that you're happy with my work and check that we're a good fit for working together.

If this sounds good, drop me a line on hello@naga.co.za.
