title: How I can help
---

Becoming an excellent user-centered team doesn’t happen overnight. Old habits die hard and figuring out what users need (rather than what they say they want) is tricky. I help teams find and make the small changes that will make a big, lasting, impact to help them in their journey. Things I do:


- run short, focused, workshops on areas of FED or UX;
- work directly with teams on a project;
- make first version of UX deliverables with teams (like Personas and Journey Maps);
- help make a clear business case for spending more time on the front-end and user experience.

I also help teams set themselves up for making continuous improvements in future by picking up bits of work that they don’t have capacity for, then walking them through what I did, how I did it, and why I made the choices I did. I help back-end developers learn more about the front-end, help front-end developers learn more about UX, and help both to write better, faster, more widely supported code.

## Technical stuff

I work on the front-end of projects across various tech stacks (Rails, Django, .NET MVC, Ember, WordPress) building templates and front-end Style Guides. I set up and use task runners like Gulp and Grunt, and use [pre-processors like Sass](/2015/03/20/getting-into-sass/) and Less to make CSS a bit friendlier to use. I make UX deliverables like [Personas](/2015/06/04/user-centered-design-things-at-praekelt/) and [Journey Maps](/2015/06/15/more-user-centered-design-things-at-praekelt/), conduct usability reviews, and [run usability tests](/2017/09/07/talking-to-people-thoughts-on-usability-testing/).
