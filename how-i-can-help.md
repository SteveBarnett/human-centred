title: How I can help
---

Becoming an excellent user-centered team doesn't happen overnight. Old habits die hard and figuring out what users need (rather than what they say they want) is tricky. I help teams **find and make the small changes that will make a big, lasting, impact** to help them in their journey. Things I do include:

- work directly with teams on a project (either as a FED or UX person);
- run short, focused, workshops on areas of FED or UX;
- make UX deliverables with teams (like Personas and Journey Maps) and help teams use them;
- help make a clear business case for spending more time on the front-end and user experience.

I also **help teams set themselves up for making continuous improvements in future** by focusing on where we want to improve rather than what we might be doing wrong.

I slot in with the existing process of the team I'm working with. I prefer agile ways of working because I like the short feedback loops and focus on learning and improvement.

## FED stuff

I work on the front-end of projects across various tech stacks, **building templates and front-end Style Guides**. I work with Rails, Django, Node, .NET, Laravel, WordPress, and static site generators like Jekyll (which [powers this site](https://github.com/SteveBarnett/nagacoza/)). I use templating engines like ERB, Jinja, Handlebars, Razor, Blade, Liquid. I also work with front-end JavaScript frameworks like Angular (a fair bit), and React and Vue (a little). 

I work best in the view layer. I can write and edit enough code to use APIs and make the most of the framework, but I tend not to touch models or controllers. I focus on the HTML and CSS (and [UX stuff](#ux-stuff)), and add small amounts of JavaScript (sometimes ES6, usually sprinkled using Babel) where necessary. I use:

- task runners like Gulp and Grunt, and set them up;
- [pre-processors like Sass](/2015/03/20/getting-into-sass/) and Less to make CSS a bit friendlier to use;
- Git for version control (with GitHub or BitBucket), and I quite like git flow as a branching strategy;
- Trello and Jira for task management.

## UX stuff

I look for where changes in process can make the biggest difference, and pick UX activities or deliverables that match the need.

- I make UX deliverables like [Personas](/2015/06/04/user-centered-design-things-at-praekelt/) and [Journey Maps](/2015/06/15/more-user-centered-design-things-at-praekelt/) to help teams have a deeper, more empathetic, understanding of their users. 
- I conduct usability reviews to find quick wins and make plans for bigger, longer term, changes. I like to sit with the team and make our own UX Checklist, based on some well-know, industry standard, ones that I [keep a list of on GitHub](https://github.com/SteveBarnett/Checklists/).
- I [run usability tests](/2017/09/07/talking-to-people-thoughts-on-usability-testing/) with the users, and ask devs to sit in so that they can see their work in action. This usually results in a big list of potential To Dos. So, we sit and prioritise the items (using Effort vs Impact or Urgent vs Important), and see what we might bring into the next sprint. Then I sit and pair program with a developer to build out the changes.

For each UX thing, I like to use **the lowest fidelity that provides good enough results**. That means a mixture of sketches (I have fancy pens), wireframes (usually in [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) because I find it's quite fast), or clickable prototypes (usually in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using something like Bootstrap for speed).
