Becoming an excellent user-centered team doesn't happen overnight. Old habits die hard and figuring out what users need (rather than what they say they want) is tricky. I help teams **find and make the small changes that will make a big, lasting, impact** to help them in their journey.

I also **help teams set themselves up for making continuous improvements in future** by focusing on where we want to improve rather than what we might be doing wrong.

## FED stuff

I work on the front-end of projects across various tech stacks, **building templates and front-end Style Guides**. I work with Rails, Django, Node, .NET, Laravel, WordPress, and static site generators like Jekyll (which [powers this site](https://github.com/SteveBarnett/nagacoza/)). I use templating engines like ERB, Jinja, Handlebars, Razor, Blade, Liquid. I also work with front-end JavaScript frameworks like Angular (a fair bit), and React and Vue (a little, but looking to do more). 

**I work best in the view layer.** I write and edit code to use APIs and make the most of the framework, but I tend not to touch models or controllers. I focus on the HTML and CSS (and [UX stuff](#ux-stuff)), and add small amounts of JavaScript (sometimes ES6, usually sprinkled using Babel) where necessary. I use:

- task runners like Gulp and Grunt, and set them up;
- [pre-processors like Sass](/2015/03/20/getting-into-sass/) and Less to make CSS a bit friendlier to use;
- Git for version control (with GitHub or BitBucket), and I quite like git flow as a branching strategy;
- Trello and Jira for task management.

## UX stuff

I look for where small changes in process can make the biggest difference, and pick UX activities or deliverables that match the need.

- I make [Personas](/2015/06/04/user-centered-design-things-at-praekelt/), [Journey Maps](/2015/06/15/more-user-centered-design-things-at-praekelt/), wireframes, and prototypes. These help teams have a deeper, more empathetic, understanding of their users, and have more clarity on what to build and why. 
- I conduct usability reviews to **find quick wins** and **make plans for bigger, longer term, changes**. I like to sit with the team and make our own UX Checklist, based on some well-know, industry standard, ones that I [keep a list of on GitHub](https://github.com/SteveBarnett/Checklists/).
- I [run usability tests](/2017/09/07/talking-to-people-thoughts-on-usability-testing/) with the users, and ask devs to sit in so that they can see their work in action. This usually results in a big list of potential To Dos. So, we sit and **prioritise the items** (using Effort vs Impact or Urgent vs Important), and see what we might bring into the next sprint. Then I sit and **pair program with a developer to build out the changes.**

For each UX deliverable, I like to use **the lowest fidelity that provides good enough results**. That means a mixture of sketches (I have fancy pens), wireframes (usually in [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) because I find it's quite fast), or clickable prototypes (usually in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using something like Bootstrap for speed).
