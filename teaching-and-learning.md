## Four phases of learning

- Preparation
  - Interest. Positive feelings, optimal state for learning.
- Presentation
  - Encounter. Interesting, enjoyable, relevant, multi-sensory.
- Practice
  - Integration. Incorporate new knowledge.
- Performance
  - Application. Apply and extend knowledge.

## Ingredients of Accelerated Learning

- Somatic
  - moving and doing
- Auditory
  - talking and hearing
- Visual
  - observing and picturing
- Intellectual
  - problem-solving and reflecting

## Better > Worse

- Movement > Sitting
- Talking > Listening
- Images > Words
- Writing > Reading
- Shorter > Longer
- Different > Same

## Training From The Back Of The Room

- Connections
  - to each other
  - to the topic
  - to learning goals and outcomes
- Concepts
  - Teach only the need to know information
  - Use graphic organisers
  - Include 1 minute reviews
- Concrete Practice
  - Mistakes are allowed (expected!)
- Celebrations

## Small Teaching

- Knowledge
  - Retrieving
  - Predicting
  - Interleaving
- Understanding
  - Connecting
  - Practicing
  - Self-explaining
- Inspiration
  - Motivating
  - Growing
  - Expanding

## Make It Stick

- To learn, retrieve
- Mix up your practice
- Embrace difficulties
- Avoid illusions of knowing (fluency â‰  mastery)
- Go beyond learning styles (underlying principles and mental models)
- Increase your abilities (growth mindset, deliberate practice, memory cues)

Learning is strong when it matters, is concrete, is personal.
