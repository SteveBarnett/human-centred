Some notes on presenting ideas. Make it...

- **Social**{: #social }
    - Connect everyone by showing shared experiences, especially struggles and failures.
    - Work in groups and pairs.

    - Have breaks that involved leaving the table.
    - Link concepts with movements to increase recall and attention.
- **Positive**{: #positive }
    - Have a physical environment that's not classroom-like.
    - Promote empathy, kindness, perspective, compassion.

    - Find things that are widely relevant, not locally specific.
- **Looped**{: #looped }
    - Frame changes as experiments (that are safe to fail).
    - Focus on effort and progress (not ability or setbacks)
    - → (Re)trial → Feedback → Reflection ↵
    - Use Spaced Retrieval to make it stick
- **Emotional**{: #emotional }
    - Use an emotional argument. Entertain and excite to overcome indifference, disinterest, apathy.
    - Use human-scale stats or vivid details. Show a big, emotional, display of the problem. Bring reality into the room.
    - Show before and after to motivate the change.
- **Short**{: #short }
    - Keep it simple and prioritise. What's the key message or concept?
    - Make small but meaningful milestones. Find the short-term reward linked to the long-term benefit.
    - Do warm-ups, easier or softer, stuff before the difficult stuff.
- **High energy**{: #high }
    - Have a strong opening.
    - Have a strong peak.
    - Have a strong closing.
- **Flexible**{: #flexible }
    - Vary type and length of activities, senses used.
    - Have a responsive curriculum (modular, chosen by learner).
    - Recognise and accept diversity.

    - Use images to make it more memorable. Use metaphors to make connections.
- **Questioning**{: #questioning }

    - Do the work. Tell learners to bring their stuff.
    - Provide a toolkit with clear, actionable, steps.
    - Practice different techniques and choosing the best fit.
- **Empathetic**{: #empathetic }
    - Understand why the change is difficult and frustrating. It takes time and needs supports.
    - Understand both sides. The pros and cons.
    - Make the change sufficiently alluring.
- **Nudging**{: #nudging }
  - Use anchoring.
  - Use loss aversion.
  - Use availability bias.
  - Use mere measurement effect (ask, for details).
  - Positive Injunctive > Negative Informational.
