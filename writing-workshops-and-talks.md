  - Bullet recap at the bottom
- **Article content**
  - Teach something you learned
  - Take people behind the scenes
  - Have a clear takeaway

  - Answer "why?"

## Workshops and talks

- **Social**{: #social }
  - Connect everyone by showing shared experiences, especially struggles and failures.
  - Work in groups and pairs.
  - Use pair share / teach back activities, have accountability buddies.
- **Physical**{: #physical }
  - Get them moving. Use activities like show of hands, walk around the room.
  - Have breaks that involved leaving the table.
  - Link concepts with movements to increase recall and attention.
- **Positive**{: #positive }
  - Have a physical environment that's not classroom-like.
  - Promote empathy, kindness, perspective, compassion.

  - Frame it. Have an agenda, outline, overview.
  - Pull the whole thing together with a narrative.
- **Practical**{: #practical }

  - Do the work. Tell learners to bring their stuff.
  - Provide a toolkit with clear, actionable, steps.
  - Practice different techniques and choosing the best fit.
- **Short**{: #short }
  - Keep it simple and prioritise. What's the key message or concept?
  - Make small but meaningful milestones. Find the short-term reward linked to the long-term benefit.
  - Do warm-ups, easier or softer, stuff before the difficult stuff.
- **High energy**{: #high }
  - Have a strong opening.
  - Have a strong peak.
  - Have a strong closing.
- **Flexible**{: #flexible }
  - Vary type and length of activities, senses used.
  - Have a responsive curriculum (modular, chosen by learner).
  - Recognise and accept diversity.
- **Concrete**{: #concrete }
  - Have integrity: be the example.
  - Use concrete examples to help focus. Look at good examples and analyse why they're good.
  - Use images to make it more memorable. Use metaphors to make connections.
- **Entrenched**{: #entrenched }
  - Make it repeatable, regular, ritual.
  - Help them establish habits.
  - Make concrete plans. Use WOOP (Wish, Outcome, Obstacle, Plan) or 5Ws and 1H.
- **Accessible**{: #accessible }
  - Share (shortened) links early, or in advance
  - Mind your language: sexism, ableism, swearing, weird references
  - Speak the alt text of content images
  - Distribute accessible slides, maybe a transcript or article

## Workshop closing activities

### For Now

- **What** will you do?
- **When** will you do it?
- **Where** will you do it?
- **Who** will be involved?
- **How** will you do it?
- **Why** do _this_?

Write a sentence starting with "I will..."

### For Now Now

- How likely are you to do this? Give it a score out of 10. 1/10 = Nope. 10/10 = Very yes.
  - No judgement! Be realistic.
- Why isn't your score **lower**?
- Is there something small you can do to make your score **higher**?

### For Later

- **Small steps**<br>Focus on progress
- **Accountability Buddy**<br>Check-in with them regularly
- **Try an Action Trigger**<br>Have an “If This, Then That” plan
